0,Tried to give these treats to two different dogs.  Both did not like it and would not eat it.,11
1,"I've been cutting back on my salt intake and thought this product would be good, however, it contains soooo much black pepper (it's the first ingredient listed on the label).  I can not use much  to season my food because the black pepper is overwhelming and then the food is too spicy and bothers my stomach. I can not recommend this product.",4
2,"I've been buying the Spearmint Altoids for years, and loved the product.  I just got a new tin of the ""New Great Taste!""--which is horrible!  It tasted like menthol!  Such a drag.  I see now that there are more artificial ingredients in it.  WHY???  I hope the company sees  the feedback and reverts back to the original recipe.  Or they'll lose a lot of customers.  They've lost me for now.",11
3,"This candy interested me - something different for trick or treat - because it was mentioned in an article in ""People"" magazine (I have written to the Editor of People).  We live on Harbour Island (Tampa), a neighborhood with many children, so it is fun to put forth an extra, creative effort each year. So I looked on-line and found these Fish Kabobs were available from a company through Amazon.  Amazon's products have always been well-packaged; sent on time; and to my satifaction.  What a surprise when I received these and found they are made in China!<br />Apparently, to send them back, it must be done through that seller - who has some odd practices.  The return postage had to be my responsibility (more than $10 sent the cheapest way); there is a 15% re-shelving fee!; and the man at TheOnlineCandyShop was nebulous as to the return address.  He thought it was on the package, but the one on the package was not right.  He gave me a different one, and I can only hope that is correct.<br />If I do receive a credit to my card, it will be very small at this point.  I was tempted to just throw the candies away.",5
4,very deceptive.  not what I wanted when I was thinking of powdered vanilla.  Is is that difficult to be honest?<br /><br />sigh........,14
5,"As much as our dogs enjoyed Lickety Stik, the cloying stench of ""savory chicken"" repulsed the rest of the family. The odor wafted off the stick and filled the room like a musky air freshener. We called it ""Icky Stik"" or ""Stinky Stik"" as the experience was so nauseating that no one volunteered to reopen the stick, despite pleas from our dogs.<br /><br />We tested the PetSafe Lickety Stik as part of the Amazon Vine program, which is to say the product arrived free. The company sent us the Savory Chicken flavor and we tested it with our Cockapoo and Miniature Schnauzer, both adult females. Neither dog had trouble figuring out how to advance the roller ball so they could taste the liquid. One warning: if you get this stuff on your hands you'll play heck trying to wash it off.<br /><br />A collective shudder ran through the family as we wondered: if Savory Chicken smells this bad, can you imagine inhaling a deep whiff of ""Braised Liver"" or ""Smoky Bacon""? Worse yet, the company touts the product's portability and recommends carrying it in your purse. That's a bit risk since this stuff in the bottle is hardly perfume.<br /><br />The company says Lickety Stick consists of all-natural ingredients. Here's the list from the bottle: Natural Chicken Flavors, Cultured Milk Lecithin, Mixed Tocopherois (Natural Preservative - A Source of Vitamin E), Ascorbyl Palmtate (Source of Vitamin C), Rosemary Extract, Green Tea Extract.<br /><br />In summary, with so many better options available for dog treats, we cannot recommend Lickety Stick because of its foul smell, sticky ingredients and the serious risk to your purse should the bottle leak.<br /><br />Rating: One star.",4
6,"The title for this product clearly stats ""Low Fat Milk"", which in my world means 1% milk. In the description, the product is listed as ""Reduced Fat Milk"", which is 2% milk.<br /><br />The product I received is 2% milk. I'm not going to return it, because that's just more trouble than it's worth. Buyer beware!!",7
7,"The Hickory was very salty, so much so that I ended up throwing it away. The regular, Barbaque, sweet and hot were all very good. I will be reordering them soon again.",4
8,"It always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly over-priced items on here.  You can bet I'll never buy anything from this vendor, even if it is a great deal.<br /><br />This is a ridiculously high price for Red Bull.  On sale in the stores one can find it for $1.50/can.  Why would someone pay more than that online?  Caveat emptor --- let the buyer beware!",0
9,I gave my german shepard one of these and it gave her diarhea.<br />I have discontinued giving them to her and will not purchase again.,11
10,"Yuck - this tea is really not to my liking.  This tea has a very unpleasant taste, something I cannot quite describe.  I have to force myself to drink it until I use up my supply.  It sort of makes me shudder as I swallow it.  I have tried brewing it for shorter times and I still don't like it.  I have also tried the Decaf White Tea, with the same opinion.<br /><br />It was surprising to me that I dislike this white tea.  I love other Good Earth tea products, with the decaf green tea and organic decaf green tea with mango being my favorites that I drink daily.<br /><br />I know the other reviewers have rated this white tea highly, but I would suggest trying a box from your local grocery before ordering in bulk.",16
11,"Couple of months ago this was $27.51.  Amazon raised the price by 30%, when it became popular.  I'll be getting mine direct.",11
12,"The label on the back went as far as making this claim: ""100% Whole Leaf Powder...not from juice!""  Ummm... the reason we drink wheatgrass JUICE, is because it's 99.9% digestable, because it doesn't contain any fiber.  Throw the fiber into it, and it takes a lot more effort and energy to digest.<br /><br />This Amazing Grass powder is gritty, and doesn't taste ANYTHING like real wheatgrass juice.  The gritty-ness is so bad, that it's very, very difficult to drink.  Do a google search and look for Wheat Grass JUICE powder.  Not just wheatgrass powder.  This stuff is 25% fiber by weight, so 25% of this product is filler.<br /><br />I used a similar cheap powder that came in a glass jar a number of years ago, and I was wary that this was the same stuff.  Sure enough, it's EXACTLY the same stuff.  You can find this stuff in bulk in canisters at Vitamin Wholesalers for 1/3 the cost.<br /><br />Again, the gritty taste and the fact that it doesn't even come close to dissolving in water should tell you something.  If it doesn't dissolve in water, it doesn't digest well in your body.",4
13,"I ordered this product to compare it to the other Oat Bran in taste and freshness which I have been fairly satisfied with.  Well, let me save others from making the same mistake I did.  I received the 32-ounce Bags (pack of 6) with a freshness expiration date in 4 months.  I was very disappointed with the fact that I cannot consume even 1/3 of the order in that expiration time frame.  The quality of the Oat Bran Taste does not measure up to what I have been ordering.  Also, in the same order, I also received another Brand of Oat Bran which has an expiration date of 18 months away.  The taste is the best of any I have tried.  I will give that product a review with 5 stars.  For the money, freshness and taste, I would not recommend this product.",1
14,"I LOVE Ella's pouches and my son does too, but the look of horror on his face when he first tried this flavor was hilarious. You'd have thought I tried to feed him poison.  Curious to know what flavor could have produced such a strong response from him, I tried the pouch myself.  EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWE!!!!!  I've never tasted anything so vial in my life.  Had we not been out in public at the time I would have spit it out on the floor.  Instead I forced myself to swallow, threw the package away immediately, and apologized profusely to my son for trying to make him eat it.  I shudder just thinking about that one awful bite I had to endure.  Blech.",4
15,"This stuff taste the worse, no sweetner helps and it stinks up the place...Stay away from this stuff, what a waste of money.",15
16,I bought this product along with Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Vegan Curry with Brown & Wild Rice Pilaf and Dr. McDougall's Hot & Sour Noodle Soup and I must say that I waste my money behind Dr. McDougall's products. All three products I bought taste very awful and worst food I have ever ate so far. I have never experienced this kind of bad taste in my life. Now I going to throw out all 15 cups. if McDougall can give me money back I for sure return all my items.,5
17,"I foolishly bought this whole case because the reviews were so good and I could not find 1 can in a local store to try.  It was the WORST canned soup I have EVER tasted, it even smells sickening, like rotten garlic.  The noodles were complete greasy mush.  I had only 2 spoonfuls and have thrown the rest away.  Do not be fooled by the picture on the label, the contents do not even come close to looking like that.  Celiacs have enough trouble finding decent food, stay away from this product.",15
18,"I cannot recommend Dr. McDougall's Pad Thai Noodle Soup. If it doesn't look like pad thai or taste like pad thai, it's probably a good idea to call it something besides pad thai. A few broken rice noodles in the bottom of a cup of dehydrated broth does not a pad thai make.<br /><br />I had this for lunch today, and the other kids pointed and laughed at me. Thai people walked past my table, frowning and shaking their heads. Soup technicians from the Department of Soup issued my lunch a cease-and-desist order. President Obama stopped by my table, gave me a stern look, and said, ""Mark, I thought we had made more progress than this. Forget the debt ceiling. We need to do something about this concoction, which is neither pad thai, nor soup, but an unsatisfying amalgamation of the two.""",12
19,"I was excited about buying these in bulk at the special price Amazon was offering. However, when I received my case of 24 8 oz bags (purchased 2 sets), I was extremely disappointed to see a use by date of 1 month later.  Even more so, when I tasted them, and like a few others pointed out, they have a very distinct burnt taste.<br /><br />Pretzels last just about forever. Realizing these are organic would allow for a shorter shelf life, but the real issue is that the shelf life was used up before the sale. So, in short, these were essentially a waste of money as I had to coax people to take them away.",1
20,"I bought this tea for the health benefits, and although I am not the biggest fan of tea, I knew that this tea was extremely overbearing and is very hard to drink. This team smelled like perfume, as well as tasted like it. It left my mouth smelling like I drank a bottle of perfume and it just wasn't pleasant at all. I can usually handle things that taste bad, but this was an exception. If you can get over the strong taste, however, I'm sure you'll be fine.",4
21,"If you like strong coffee, as I do this coffee is over rated. I found it weak, with a sickening after  taste.",16
22,"I ordered this product thinking it would be similar to the rock sugar I was using all over Germany this past winter.  They also sell it at Teavana but at an extremely high price compared to what I brought back from Germany (obviously there is a big expense on bringing sugar to the US).  I was excited to find these online and the picture looked like what I had brough back from Germany.  I'm not sure it was the same thing.  The crystals weren't the same color as the German rock sugar, it was cloudy in color and was more like pebbles vs. rocks.  The order took an entire 2 or 3 weeks to actually process and ship, come to find out, the place it shipped from was in my state.  I thought it was completely ridiculous how long it took and when it arrived it was poorly packaged.  It came in a white box (similar to a shirt box but a bit smaller) and the rocks were all falling out of it and pressed up against the box (between the it and the worn and dirty looking plastic wrapping that enclosed the box).  When I opened the plastic liner, the box was so flimpsy the sugar was going all over my counter despite how careful I was seeing how damaged the box was.  Never again.",7
23,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR ANY CHICKEN JERKY TREAT PRODUCT FROM CANYON CREEK RANCH OR ANY OTHER DISTRIBUTOR OF PRODUCTS FROM CHINA UNTIL THE FDA ADVISES THE PRODUCTS ARE SAFE AGAIN. Last month the FDA issued a warning advising people not to buy chicken jerky treats made in China [...]. Unfortunately I didn't hear of the warning until it was too late. I gave both my dogs one Yam-Good each for about a month and the result was they almost died from vomiting and bloody stool. Despite their American sounding name, Canyon Creek Ranch IS MADE IN CHINA AND SAYS SO ON THE PACKAGE. Even worse, no where on their website or on Amazon does it mention the FDA warning or that the product is toxic. These lovely little treats nearly cost me the lives of both my dogs, as well as over $500 in vet bills and time off of work.",11
24,"I feel it is almost irresponsible to NOT let people know the poor quality of this product. Look at all the bad reviews. Tasteless, gross and not a popcorn most people would eat even if it were free. That a major food company has this product on the market is hard to believe.",7
25,"I have bought these in the health food store and although they do not taste the best, they are the greatest for dieting and digestion. Unfortunately these were horrifically stale. I will not buy online again.",0
26,"This review is about the product the seller was great!<br /><br />I heard it was good for sleep couldn't find it local so i bought it here. It stunk up my house, taste awful. save your money and buy any other tea out there.",0
27,"This drink is very good, and tastes great. The only issue, is that there have recently been spoiled drinks I have been receiving. I do love the drinks, and I am a loyal customer, but please be careful if you get any spoiled drinks. You can get very sick from them. Just be careful, and enjoy the healthy drinks! Thank you!",4
28,"The food deserves 5 stars, but the seller (1800PetMeds) deserves zero stars, if that could be assigned. My dog has allergies, but does well on this brand of non-grain dog food. I thought it would be smart to order through Amazon, since it is difficult to find in stores, but that was a mistake. It has been 14 days since I ordered, and the product has not yet arrive. Nine days after the order, it had not even shipped. And while it was shipped via Fedex, the Fedex tracking says the order will take about 6 to 7 days to deliver. The seller must have asked for special slow delivery... Never again will I buy from this seller.",5
29,"My mistake for not reading the only comment that gave this a 1 star.  Just as peg noted, the item shown is NOT what you get.  Very disappointed with this type of poor advertising.  You show me a picture of a big tub'o mustard and call it a dispenser pack, guess what! I expect a big tub'o mustard not a silly refill pack!  Come on folks, let's get it together!",7
30,"Canidae has changed the formula of their ALS recipes.  Many, many dogs have become ill after eating the new formula.  The web is full of complaints from dog owners whose dogs are experiencing the same awful symptoms (Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, hot spots and even seizures).  Do your homework before buying this product.  The company changed the formula without notifying the public.  Would give zero stars if possible.",11
31,I love the product and have bought at other places.  The reason I bought this from Amazon is they had a deal that allowed me to buy it for much less per bag than other places.  When I got it I noticed one of the 12 bags was opened already.  OK I was still in the black on the deal but after I put it on the shelf for a few days I pulled it down to get another bag and 3 more were open.  4 of the 12 bags were open and that isn't acceptable.,1
32,"I think a better description of all Non-Traditional, Gummy  Products as these are needed to eliminate confusion.  These Gummy s, as the other Single Fruit Line are covered in Crystallized Sugar, and are more of a Sweet candy.  Traditional Gummbybears are aSoft in and out single source candy, the one we had as kids, these are quite sweet and hard to enjoy.",2
33,"The product arrived at the door, with the inside content completely melted. I called the company to let them know what happened, and their only response was that they were so swamped with product orders that they just had no choice but to ship out the product without proper ice/temp-controlled packaging. Seriously?  This is chocolate covered wine grape they are selling!  No refund. No credit towards next purchase. Needless to say, I would never order from them again. Shame, because it's a great product idea.",7
34,"Please dont buy this product , the bacon was always burnt and gross when i used this product no matter the setting, I going to buy one of those microwavable trays ive seen at walmart because i know those things actually work. This thing was also very hard to clean....just a bad product.",15
35,"I tried this once. You can get the same thing by buying some popping corn in your local grocery, popping it, pouring it into a bowl, and adding milk. This made me reluctant to try other Kashi products.<br /><br />Frankly, I don't see why people continue to pay an outrageous price for what amounts to popcorn.<br /><br />PS. Amazon should add a zero star rating.",0
36,"This bread is the worst I've had. My husband is diabetic and will eat anything that is ""legal"" for him....and he even threw it away. The bread tastes like a dry sponge. Very disappointed.",13
37,"I buy treats for my dogs in bulk to have them on hand. I opened this package 2 months after purchase, which meant it is too late to return, and found the product to be moldy. This is even though the expiration date hasn't been reached yet. Also, the sweet potatoes are soft, as if they are not fully dehydrated. I've bought this product at local stores and haven't had a problem. This must be part of a bad batch. I won't be buying this product or other dog treats from Amazon again, as now I am out of the money I paid.",1
38,"Nestle makes some seriously lousy cocoa. If you can taste any cocoa or mint in this bland product, you don't have a human tongue. The drink you're supposed to enjoy smells exactly like bales of hay. And twenty seven clams? Does it come with shares of stock in the company?",9
39,All my potatoes packages arrived open! I live at 9.000 ft and I don't know if the pressure change was to blame. I have ordered many other potato chips brands in the past and this has never happened before.,8
40,"I'm not sure what I was expecting with this product as it's sodium free, but my first use of it just made me throw it out. Not a pleasant taste at all.",4
41,"I thought I would give these a try since the nespresso caps are so tasty hence we go thru them quickly. Thought I would try a knock off for half the price. NOT worth it! Stick with the real thing or try another alternative because these are WEAK, WATERY and YUCKY. Maybe if I was try to ween myself off a nespresso habit but I am not so I do not enjoy them at all. :(<br />I tried the 3 strongest options and they were all week. Had to do short pulls and a 3:1 ratio was still not equal to 1 weak nespresso cap.<br />The shipping and service was great, just not the product. Plus to add insult, they dropped the price from 25$ a box down to 10$. At $10 try them yourself and you can taste disappointing brown water too!",0
42,"I should've done more research before buying this product. My dog seemed to have very little appetite when she was on this food. She had skin problems. She had loose stools. Unfortunately I didn't want to believe that it had anything to do with the food. I finally decided to look into it after months of trying to get her to eat it more regularly and found that my problems weren't uncommon with this food. I've since switched her to Blue Buffalo food and her skin problems have gotten better, she has become more energetic, her stools are no longer loose and she happily eats.",11
43,I had such high hopes for this coffee after reading the reviews but all I can say is...it was just AWFUL!  I would return it if I could.,16
44,"This is the absolute worst flavored coffee I ever put in my mouth.  I took several sips to be sure I hated it.  On the fourth sip I had to spew it back into the cup.  I thought possible the shipment was tainted with chemicals.  Please don't buy a large quantity that you'll have to pawn off on someone.  For those who like it, enjoy.",15
45,"This is a delicious tea.  I bought a canister of it at Whole Foods, and used most of it up pretty quickly.<br /><br />Then I noticed that my teeth had turned color.  After noticing that, it occurred to me that pretty much everything that had come into contact with this tea, including my mugs, tea spoons, spatula, stove-top pot, had turned color a bit.<br /><br />A professional cleaning at the dentist, and a lot of soaking and scrubbing of my mugs, helped a lot -- but be warned that this tea (at least the batch I got) can wreck your smile very quickly.  I won't drink it again.",10
46,"this stuff sux!!! i used to love ovaltine,  and now tht they have changed it, its totally descusting!!! i cant fathom why they would even want to change it!! eeeew. :(((((",12
47,This tea is fantastic - but this is a TERRIBLE DEAL. Check out another site for a better price.  You shouldn't pay more than $14.00 for a 24 count box of this green tea.,0
48,"I agree with the other reviewer, but I think cereal marshmallows are gross and never liked teddy grahams that much anyway.",9
49,"Do you know those Tootsie Pop commercials where they'd see how many times the Tootsie Pop could be licked before they'd chew right into it?  That's how this Likety Stik worked with my dog.  He licked it three or four times, then immediately wanted to chew on the roller.  I repeatedly pulled it out each time he'd try, but it kept repeating.  Lick, lick, lick, chew.  Lick, lick, lick chew.  Within one minute, no exaggerating, he had chewed off the end and I was scared to death that he'd swallow the roll ball. Fortunately he spit it out, but if he had swallowed it, he easily could have choked to death on it with it blocking his windpipe.  I would never buy this product again, and highly recommend others not to.  Seriously, it was completely chewed through in one minute of opening the package.",15
50,"i personaly didnt like them, allitle to sweet and the combination of sweet and sour just wasnt right. im gona stick with normal gummys because these were dissapointing.",8
51,"The description for the item is wrong.<br />It does contain MSG - Monosodium Glutamate.<br />It also contains preservatives.<br />This item should not be called ""All Natural""",7
52,"This box contained a lot of decaf & coffee that is not extra bold.  The name of the product has ""Extra Bold"" in it.  This was a bait-and-switch, without question.  Do not purchase this product.",16
53,Have ordered and TRIED to use the Kcups by Emeril -- It is like throwing away your money!  They make a mess of your<br />Keurig and put coffee grounds in your cup of coffee.  As far the taste -- who knows with the coffee grounds in the cup.<br />Try a different type of Kcup and save yourself the money.,16
54,"I was expecting something amazing by the reviews and I really should have listened to the last review before purchasing, but I decided to give them a chance. They are way too sugary and lack flavor. They taste like those bland fruit slices you get at the store. Not impressive and frankly I had 3 and I was sick to my stomach because of how overly sweet they are. I returned them.",8
55,I should have paid more attention to the photos of this product when purchasing it.. I thought it looked like it was red-ish brown..but it is truly as red as Kool-aid and tastes completely unlike tea to me - it was most like unsweetened Kool-aid in my opinion.<br /><br />I'm an avid iced tea drinker - I drink it year 'round and a pitcher of tea is always at the ready in our fridge. I tried this tea to see if it would be a nice one to add to my rotation (I like Paradise Iced Tea and China Mist Mango & Passion Fruit ice teas). It was so horrible tasting I couldn't drink it. It doesn't taste like Mango at all - it tastes vaguely of herbal hibiscus and rose - it doesn't taste fruity at all.<br /><br />I plan to give it away to someone who likes herbal teas -- because I'm quite certain it lacks any black tea (or any tea at all?)..and therefore wouldn't be useful to me (I like caffeine in my tea).,4
56,"Ok, I love the Aerogarden and it worked great with my last batch of herbs. But the tomatos grow very fast and even with tons of trimming, I can't seem to keep them away from the lights. But that is not the biggest problem. Since the roots are not attached to anything, the tomato plants fall over in all directions. You can TRY to follow the instructions to tie them up somehow but the reality with the garden is that it is not easy to do so. There is only the one hood support to use. So even using garden ties, velcro, etc, the plants are always flopping around. If Aerogrow is reading this - I have a suggestion for you: Use the four ""unused"" holes in the tray to hold some sort of support towers for plants that get that big or need to climb. There could be some sort of snap in cone or something to help hold plants up.",15
57,"I got several packages of this and I will never order it again. I put in my pantry and a week later started to notice a sour smell in there. I could not pin point it but when I went to make soup that afternoon pulled out one of these and it was all moldy! The seal had broken in shipment and another had been leaking. It was a terrible mess, even the one that was still good and sealed tasted bland and I was afraid to use it.<br />What a waste of money.",15
58,I have been using go-grape for years.  This new formula really sucks. Give me the old formula back. I will have to find a new flavor now.,11
59,"This coffe is terrible, too sweet and it does not taste like Cappuccino at all. Save yourself some money and buy real coffee like the San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser for your Keurig. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q1YA"">Grove Square Cappuccino Cups, French Vanilla, Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24 Count</a>",14
60,"Nothing special here. It's just hyped up water. Tastes like water, feels like water. No special energy from this water. And the price??? Are you kidding me??? Total rip-off! Drink tap or cheap bottled water!",10
61,I ordered this product 9/15 and have stll not received it 10/18 so I can't review product only poor delivery.,7
62,"Imagine what a packing peanut might taste like, if it were flat, crisp, and really salty.  That's this cracker.  I would never put cheese on this thing.  It'll work for hummus but that's about all.",15
63,"The only good comment I can give on these treats is that my cat liked them when they were fresh, and they are really inexpensive! I can usually find these treats for under two dollars at the grocery or pet store, and even on occasion at the dollar store. As this treat proves, often with a low price, comes a cheap product.  It would be nice if these pounce treats had healthier ingredients, maybe some vitamins or a dental cleanser, but no, its just junk food and a long list of filler ingredients. They smell really gross to me but my cat seemed to enjoy them. My biggest reason for not liking this treat, aside from the terrible ingredients and smell, is the fact that it is soft and chewy and not crunchy texture. Soft treats reek havoc on pet teeth as the sticky particles just sit on their teeth and gums and just rot there. Crunchy treats at least crunch off and don't stick to their teeth- hopefully crunching off some tarter with it. For a really good dental product, I recommend Crunch N' Clean brand with DentaShield. Greenies brand doesn't have as many beneficial dental ingredients, but they are pretty good as well as they contain vitamins and a little bit of breath freshening ingredients in them, so they are much better than these. Any crunchy treat would be better than these. Even other Pounce varieties are MUCH better than these, such as the Tarter & Plaque control varieties. The Pounce Tarter & Plaque control are a bit more pricey, but still relatively inexpensive and they contain vitamins and are crunchy. Another strange thing about these treats is that the recommended daily allotment is 6-8 treats per day, which is just crazy to me. I only give my cats no more than 1-2 a day of these while I had them. I eventually threw them out as they got hard as rocks and my cats didn't like them anymore anyhow.<br /><br />Pros: cat approved taste while fresh; and very fair price<br />Cons: bad smell, lack of nutrition, terrible texture for teeth",11
64,"I bought the popchips variety pack to try the different flavors and I kept an open mind but I just don't like this flavor.  Their other flavors like BBQ & salt and vinegar are great, but these are REALLY peppery.  I can't even taste the salt on them because the pepper is so overwhelming.  Might be your bag of tea if you like a lot of pepper on food, but my husband puts pepper on everything and even he said there was too much pepper here.",8
65,"BBQ and pasta. That should have stopped me right there but it didn't. It did stop me from fixing it for a while but I eventually took the plunge.<br /><br />It is just not very good at all. Maybe if you've never had BBQ or good BBQ this might be passable but otherwise just think it over - pasta with BBQ sauce - and let that be your guide.<br /><br />For completeness, what really struck me wrong about it was the texture with the flavor. It was odd to say the least. Not inedible but weird in a bad way.<br /><br />If you like BBQ sauce and you are a big pasta fan then this probably is worth a try. Everyone else should avoid it.",9
66,This is my son's favorite food brand but we buy it at Whole Foods and Babies R Us for about $1.75 each.  I can't figure out why Amazon is charging almost triple. ???,9
67,"After reading the ingredients (and being familiar with Paul Newman's great-tasting salad dressings), I was excited about feeding this dog food to my older rescue doberman.<br /><br />I was surprised when I opened the first can because it truly looked like it had been eaten and passed through another dog's intestines.  Sorry to be so graphic but that's the truth.  It's hard to give my dog food that I dont even want to touch.  She loved the taste, though, and that was the important thing.<br /><br />That night, however, my poor dog was in agony and had black, watery diarrhea all over the house.  Twenty-four hours later she still wasnt feeling well.  I gave her Imodium and considered taking her to the vet.<br /><br />I'm happy for those dogs that like this food and dont suffer any side-effects.  I wish my dog were one of them.",11
68,"There are 80 calories per cup of this coffee, 40 of those are from fat. The description says it is mildly sweet but I found it overwhelmingly sweet. There was little to no coffee taste, more like Cremora or Coffee Mate with fake sugar. I tried brewing one k cup of this coffee and then in the same cup added another k cup which was regular coffee in hopes of diluting the sweetness but even that way, it was still very sweet and whatever creamer they used was the dominant flavor by far.<br /><br />If you take a lot of cream and sugar in your coffee, you might like this coffee. I didn't like it at all.",4

Thought it might have been a bad can so we tossed what was left.  Gave them another can the next day and same thing, all three cats became sick, vomited, lethargic and stopped eating for several days.  We went back to a food from our vets and now after several days they are OK again and eating normally.  I don't know if this was just a bad case of food or if Wellness has a quality control problem, but I would hesitate to purchase another product from Wellness.",11

Indicated that they were unable to fulfill the order at the price that I bought them at, even though they sent me confirmation that my order had been accepted and that my credit card was already charged.<br /><br />The other issue that happened is that their ""cancellation email"" was sent out in bulk, with my email address a part of close to 25-30 others - not sure why this wasn't handled individually or at least via bcc so that others wouldn't have my information.<br /><br />If this was indeed part of a pricing error, I don't have a problem with them cancelling the order, per Amazon's regulations for dealing with third-party vendors. I just think they handled this very poorly and ultimately aren't paying enough attention to details if so many customers were affected by this.<br /><br />Questionable business ethics - Buyer Beware!",5

80,"My girlfriend and I picked up a box of these from Costco, and had high hopes that they'd be delicious, natural crackers.  We are very open-minded about natural foods and most of the stuff we eat is very healthy and natural.  Well these crackers just taste burnt and bitter; they have the right ingredients, but the flavor just doesn't work.  We have previously bought, and still buy, the Crunchmaster Multigrain Crackers <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YJBLMM"">Crunchmaster Multi-Grain Crackers Gluten Free 20 oz.</a>, and have found them to be the BEST natural, gluten-free, multigrain crackers on the market.  We're going to stick with the Crunchmaster crackers, they have a fantastic flavor, are very healthy, and go with everything great (cheese, dips, peanut butter, you name it).<br /><br />Another reviewer here noted that these taste like ""burnt birdseed""; couldn't agree more, they were a huge disappointment. If you do decide to try these crackers, be sure to buy a very small box, then you won't feel as ripped off when you realize they are borderline inedible.",8

While touted as one of their more durable toys, I found the plush toys to be more durable than this!<br /><br />I bought this as a replacement puzzle toy for one of my dogs, who adores plush toys and puzzle toys.  The second dog I have is more destructive and you really have to watch him with toys.  I was hopeful that the plastic would hold up better and the plush-lover would get more enjoyment out of his toy before it would get destroyed.<br /><br />The moon rover was much too difficult to get into (or out of) the moon; neither dog was able to retrieve it.  Within 30 minutes chunks of the moon were missing and the front part of the rover was chewed off as well.  Even though we're thorough, we were picking up chunks of blue plastic around the play area for a few days.  This purchase was a complete waste of $20.",15
82,"I bought these oats to sprout for my raw oatmeal, but they do not sprout. I believe they are treated with heat or some form of steaming - so they are not raw. Very disappointed. I wish the product description would have explained that these oats are treated and are not for sprouting.",10
83,"I did not like this product. Something in it - sage maybe - was overwhelming. I even cut it with something and still it was too much. Also, the ingredients were not listed on the side of the box; it just said ""spices."" That seems a little odd to me.",9
84,"I purchased this because I was watching the Reluctantly Healthy videos on yahoo, and one of them said drinking green powder is good for you. This was the first thing that came up on amazon when I searched 'green powder'. The price was reasonable ($15.00) but when I opened it, it has a strong smell of raspberry and acai berry. When you make it, because its more ground up veggies than powder, it periodically sinks to the bottom so you have to stir it when you want a drink. To mew it tasted like a mixture of pet store food and the acai berry, which I'm not a fan of. The drink gave me a headache, and at the end of my work day it had made me so sick i ended up having to pull over on the side of the road and throw up.",4

We did feel a little more sleepy than normal after taking it.  But other than that, this product did absolutely nothing to either one of us.

92,"I've been looking for an affordable source of sulfite-free lemon juice since Costco stopped carrying ""Italian Volcano"" brand locally.<br /><br />This looked like a possible alternative; the amazon price wasn't bad, and it was called ""natural"".  The ad above does NOT list the ingredients.  And I went to the Sadaf website which ALSO does not list the ingredients. So I wrote their website and asked nicely if it contained sulfites, and after a week I got back a terse reply that said ""read the label"".  They HAVE a label on their website, but it doesn't have ingredients on it.<br /><br />So I had to dig into googling for research, and I finally found a complaint against their firm (you can find it too, just google ""Sadaf Lemon Sulfites"") which accused them of falsely using the word ""natural"" despite the fact that their juice contains sulfites.<br /><br />So despite their being - seemingly - intentionally obscure about this, this product is full of sulfites, and should be avoided by those who are sulfite sensitive.<br /><br />The ""Sadaf"" people don't make it easy to find this out, and refused to answer me honestly.  My recommendation is to give this product a pass.",4
93,I bought these after seeing the chocolate pasta on the cooking network. She made her own but I didn't have the time to make the pasta so I thought this would be the same. Boy was I wrong...it's bland and tastes nothing like chocolate. You are better off using normal pasta instead of this.,13
94,"I like the concept of this product. There are plenty of people out there who dislike drinking plain water, either because their local water has chlorine or minerals, or just because their tongues demand more flavor. This little plastic bottle could fit into a bag or purse or pocket, and whenever life presented a person with a glass (or bottle) of water, they were one squirt away from a more palatable drink. Especially for people trying to break the expensive and unhealthy soft drink habit, this could be a godsend.<br /><br />Except it tastes disgusting. The 'sweet tea' flavor is just sweet, no tea. It looks a little like tea, due to all of the artificial coloring, but the only flavor is artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Just to make sure my dislike for this wasn't based on the fact that i don't drink much soda, i asked a family member with a diet coke habit to take a sip. He, despite drinking artificially-sweetened artificially-colored drinks every day, also found this revolting.<br /><br />As with any food or drink, one person's appreciation is never universal. I hated this. It doesn't mean everyone will. It may suit your needs better than it suited mine. I, however, would not accept another package of this product unless it came with a $5 bill taped to the side, and even then i'd keep the money and toss the mio.",4

100,"This item was a bit of a disappointment. I expected better flavor. It has a sour start but that is it. The cherry and soda flavor is very faint and difficult to taste. The texture is what you would expect from a quality gummy, soft and slightly firm but chewy. The sour is spot on, it will make you pucker. e.frutti normally has wonderful products with abundant flavor, sadly this product was not one of them. I ordered 4 bags (8.8 pounds), opened one and ate a few and gave the three remaining bags away to less discriminate gummy consumers. I rated this product low because I expected better flavor and not just sour gummy. If you enjoy sour and are less concerned with flavor, this product may be right for you.",4

I was surprised because Melissa's usually has a superior product.  Perhaps the stems are included because this can also be used as a tea.",1
105,"Okay, first of all, this says for dogs AND cats, and I sampled it because it actually only said ""cat treats.""  Ummm, I have three cats, and none of them would touch this stuff.  First of all, they're HUGE, round discs.  You have to break it up into about 30 pieces (which is soft and gross and makes your hands stink) and even then, none of my cats were at all enthused with the results.  They sniffed, turned their nose up, and walked away.<br /><br />The dog however, was happy to clean up behind them.  She loved these treats, and they're definitely more large-dog size.  Each treat is a couple inches in diameter, almost an inch thick, I have NO IDEA why they would label these as cat treats.<br /><br />They're a little expensive for what they are, and there aren't that many in the package.  However the ingredients are good, and my dog loved them.  I'm just pretty disappointed these weren't cat treats since that's what I had originally wanted.<br /><br />Good for dogs, find something else if you have a cat!",11

107,"This crickets are a terrible value, have no flavor, and come in very small portions. Despite the advertised three flavors, I found all of the crickets to have more of a texture than a flavor and couldn't really distinguish between the advertised flavors strongly.

110,"This was a bit of a disappointment, it offered so much promise but the packaging is a bit vague on how to make the best use of it. I tried to make it up in two different ways but it did not seem to have any taste. One serving suggestion on the package suggests making it with Apple Juice, but, to be honest the Apple Juice tasted better on it's own.<br />If anyone can offer a better serving suggestion I will be willing to try it again and update my review.",2

When it works like a charm, it's not uncommon to find coffee grounds in the cup. It's a mess.  I bought the same model for the office. The experience was similar.  Sometimes it makes a full cup of coffee other times it doesn't.  Sometimes it won't even work at all.  We have to turn it on and off and cross our fingers. A friend reports these problems as well.  I agree with the reviewer who says, DO NOT BUY.  A waste of money for the machine,for the K-cup that couldn't be used, and an exercise in frustration. We're in the market for a different brand.  When Keurig first came out, they had the market.  They have a lot of competition now . . . which hopefully will make it easier to find a machine that works well.",14

Maybe they should have used ""elephant snot"" or a rubbery type of glue that actually comes off.<br /><br />While the flowering teas are visually stunning & different, I disagree with the claim that each one makes 3 pots. Are they talking about the small/flimsy pot that comes with the teas (which does not hold more than 8 oz)?  That doesn't constitute a pot of tea to me. I tried making a 2nd pot (16 oz) & it turned out to be so weak as to be undrinkable. Also, even with looking at the provided photo ""legend"" of each tea, it is still hard to distinguish some teas from another.<br /><br />I enjoyed the 2 black teas, but mostly was unimpressed with the flavors of the green & white teas.

I have no special dietary needs, but if I had to maintain a gluten free diet, then this Whenever Bar would be of greater interest to me. But, at 180 calories in a 1.41 ounce snack bar and only 24g or 8% DV of dietary fiber, there are better and less expensive bars on the market from which those on no food restrictions may choose. The mouth feel was moist and chewy as advertised, but the flavor was not memorable.  On the plus side, this bar did not contain high fructose corn syrup or artificial sweetener. And, it has only 6% DV of cholesterol and of salt. So, bottom line, those on gluten restricted diets may well wish to try this bar. Energy bars are very handy for travel. Nice to have when you get stuck in an airport or have a late arrival and all the food places are closed. But, whereas these bars cost close to $4.00 each, it is possible to buy other brands of healthy bars at a quarter the price. So, thanks to small size, high cost, non memorable taste and high calorie count, I ended up rating these a two star.",8

134,I read 10 reviews that said this was the greatest soy milk product and 1 review that said it had a funny after taste and recommended the Silk Soy. I have to agree with the one review. I'm not sure what it is but it has almost a medicinal taste. I was ordering Silk but the subscription service on Silk Vanilla Soy was cancelled by Amazon. I'm not sure why. I tried this brand but it really is not a good substitute.<br /><br />Who knew?,16

136,"I bought a box of this herbal tea at my local grocery store and highly recommend trying a smaller quantity before committing to 6 boxes of it here.  Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor ""blossomed"" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea ""dances around the sides of your tongue.""  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the ""flavor burst"", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The ""flavor burst"" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil.",4

139,"Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot.  Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is ""imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west.""<br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the ""wet"" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer).",13
140,"Our family is addicted to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC734G"">Izze Sparkling Juice Variety Pack - 12/12 Oz Btls</a> during the summers so we gave these a try, mostly because of the additional flavors.  Unfortunately rather than the refreshing, more understated tastes of Izzies, this soda has a more syrupy Jolly Rancher flavor.  My seven year-old gives this 5 stars, but it is a little too much for an adult palette.<br /><br />We still appreciate a soda replacement with no added sugar or preservatives.  It saves a little on the guilt.  We also tried Switch's Kiwi Berry which was not as sickeningly sweet for adults and still a hit with kids, but we will be getting Izzies for treats on a hot summer day.",4

When I travel and I see The illy sign outside a deli or a coffee-house I know I am going to get a good cup of coffee....<br />But..When I bought this here Moka roast I must admit I am a little disappointed. Not much punch here. it's not like the Moka coffee I was use to when I was living in Europe. We europeans when we think of caffe Moka we consider it a much more dense and stronger cup of coffee.. a darker and more dense roasting of the beans as well.<br />A good somewhat darker cup of coffee, Yes..but no Moka...<br />Not enough ""Moka"" in this one illy, sorry, back to the lab again and give us a real Moka, Please.....<br /><br />Hugs",16
142,I bought this product due to all the good reviews.  I bbq using a weber smokey mountain often.  I usually make my own rubs.  I thought this might be a good product to keep on hand in case I didn't feel like making a rub.<br /><br />Most good bbq rubs have a base of salt and brown sugar.  This rub does not contain any sugar.  It is however very heavy on the salt.  I am used to using a large amount of rub when bbq to get a nice bark.  I made some ribs using this rub and they were so salty they were almost inedible.  I tasted the rub before hand and cut it with some brown sugar but clearly not enough.<br /><br />I have used this rub on other foods and had better results.  A little is very delicious on french fries or corn on the cob where I use this in place of salt.<br /><br />If you intend on using this rub heavily for low and slow cooking plan on cutting it heavily with brown sugar.  I prefer a salty spicy rub over an overly sweet rub but this is too much on its own.  I just wish they used more of the other ingrediantes and less salt as the spice is very tasty.<br /><br />If you plan on using this to spice up other foods in place of salt you may be very happy with this.,8

I then put them in the cubbard and I found her in the cubbard one day crying to get out. Its insane. She acts like someone on crack. Im starting to question what they put in these. Is there really a lot of regulation regarding cat snacks. I doubt it. Ive tried to stop giving them to her but she then turns her back to me and pouts for days to weeks on end. It has taken me a while to figure out what was going on with her and I have narrowed it down to these Temptation snacks. Im concerned about what drugs they put in these.,15

This defeats much of the purpose of a K-Cup, having a sealed package with nitrogen gas to keep it fresh until ready to use. When I opened the bag, it was a great smell, as all the aroma escaped into the atmosphere!<br />Know how do you keep the rest fresh? Opening and closing a zip lock isn't going to cut it, as air gets in each time.<br />Also, without the cup, I don't think the coffee gets a chance to 'seep' long enough, as it seems a bit weak for something called Fog Cutter.<br />Think I'll avoid this one in the future.",7

153,"My only foray into Gloria Jean's brand of k cups before this one was when I tried the Hazelnut flavor that was included in the sample pack that was included with our new brewer.  Needless to say, I was unimpressed with it.  I had all but written Gloria Jean off as a weak coffee brand when my boyfriend's sister gave us a few of her Butter Toffee k cups to try out, insisting they were much better than the Hazelnut.  At that point I hadn't tried another butter toffee flavored coffee from any of the other brands, so I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />What a letdown.<br /><br />Butter toffee does smell like its namesake when it is being brewed.  I had a lot of hope for it because of how it made my kitchen smell during the brewing process.  The flavor follow-up was nothing short of weak, though.  For one thing, I couldn't detect any butter toffee flavor in the coffee itself at all.  Shame.  The other downside is that, instead of being just a slightly boring, but good cup of regular coffee, this one somehow managed to be bitter and weak at the same time.  Nothing robust or flavorful about it.  Just weak coffee with a terrible aftertaste.<br /><br />So I've only had the chance to try two of Gloria Jean's flavors so far, but I definitely won't be going out of my way to try any others.  I'll stick to Timothy's and Caribou Coffee from now on.",16

But this Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor. Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor.  I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own.  There's something off about this - it's got a strongly astringent, bitter flavor.  I wonder if it's because the spices are ground to a powder?  The best chai is made with whole spices.",16

Because my perfect sweetness is ZERO. I like my coffee black or at least have the option to sweeten to taste with Stevia or Agave. I hesitated buying this for a long time because of the added sugar which I hate any product does, but really needed a quick pick-me-up specific for the hot weather. I didn't find any other option for iced instant, so I reluctantly bought this at my grocery store. When I poured the contents, I could barely even see any coffee, it was sugar in practically a 4-to-1 ratio! I check the back, 11 grams of sugar for HALF the packet. Gross. Hopefully something better will come along the way soon... or I should stop slacking and make a pitcher of coffee ahead of time to bring to work, le sigh.",4
157,"I got two bags of this sea salt after I had a small sample shaker that I really loved. It has excellent flavor, is genuine sea salt, and you use less sea salt than regular salt when seasoning food because it is a stronger flavor. All good things.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after many, many tries to ensure it wasn't my imagination...both bags contained sand as well. Something must have been wrong with their filtering system to eliminate sand from the salt during manufacturing. But, because it happened in both bags I had bought I felt it must not be too uncommon.<br /><br />Imagine when I cooked an egg dish to share with the office at breakfast...you know how it is when you eat something at the beach and, no matter how careful you are, some sand gets in so you bite down on grit? That was take one.  Then I made soup...with sand...take two....After two more tries I knew it wasn't a fluke of the kitchen or the dish or some odd salt. After all, salt dissolves in cooking. I tried both bags and gave up.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's awful. The taste was good and I might try it again in the future...but this is a fairly exceptional flaw so I gotta pan the cooking results it produced for now.",8

159,"As of this review, I've also tried Taste of Thai, Thai Kitchen and Thai Pavilion versions. For a Dr. McDougal product, the amount of sodium is inexcusable. Taste of Thai was the lowest in sodium (and best tasting of all, by far) clocking in at just 320 mg. Next in the sodium ladder is Thai Kitchen at 650 mg., then Thai Pavilion at 810 mg. The Dr. McDougal version, which the label says has 480 mg. is for a very small serving size, less than half a serving compared to all the others. So, multiply the McDougal version by 2 to get the real comparative sodium and you're at 960 mg. Like I said, inexcusable and from supposedly a ""healthy"" product. All I can say is watch your blood pressure folks.",8

I swallowed about three gulps and poured out the rest into the sink. It has a very strong after taste. Yuk.  Thankfully, I only received one packet of this stuff.  I would never pay a dollar per packet for this stuff.  The contents say this has acai and green tea leaf extract as the main ingredients.

You'd think that one packet is meant for an entire gallon and not just a little over one cup.<br /><br />Making the drink is simple- add the packet's contents to a cup, add hot water and drink it when you're ready. The smell is great, and I couldn't wait to try it out. Good god is the flavor bold. I only suggest buying this drink if you REALLY love ginger. I mean...if you go crazy like Taz when someone even mutters the word, then you will probably like this stuff. I could barely detect any hint of lemon, the other flavor featured, because the ginger sucker punches you in the mouth relentlessly. Take a big ginger root, blend it, and that's how this tastes.<br /><br />Even now, 5 hours after trying it out, I can still taste it. And this is after having eaten dinner and lots of water and milk.

Here are the negatives:<br /><br />- Dissolves horribly.  I have to prepare bottles ahead of time, refrigerate them, then warm them to use it.  My baby would take a bottle at room temperature, but if I did that there would be clumps of formula left behind.<br />- Has corn syrup in it (listed as Organic Glucose Syrup Solids).  Ok, so it isn't GMO corn syrup, but who cares?  There is no reason to include this except to save money.  It is a cheaper carbohydrate source than lactose, so they can use less lactose (lactose being something that actually has nutrional value).<br />-Has Palm Olein Oil in it.  Again, it is organic, but so what?  Another cheap ingredient (this time a fat source).  Palm Olein oil has been shown to block absorption of calcium in the body.  Oh good, because the first year of life isn't a crucial time for bone development or anything.  Even Similac won't use it.  Here is a link to study by the American Acadamy of Pediatrics from 2002(!) showing infants fed formula with palm olein oil had lower bone density than those without, and yet Hain doesn't care enough to stop using it: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/111/5/1017<br />-Has Martec DHA/AHA in it.  This is a genetically modified product and the fact that it has been allowed in organic food is just an example of how powerful lobbyists are.  If they have to use chemical neurotoxins to get the DHA/AHA, I'd rather just do without, thanks.  I know of no studies that show the level of DHA/AHA in baby formulas do anything positive for a baby's brain development.  There have also been reports of babies experiencing stomach upset from DHA/AHA in formulas.

192,"Works well enough, but needs to hold about 10% more so you can actually get a whole pound of meat into it including the inevitable air pockets.<br /><br />Also, I needed to replace one of the nozzles (damaged in the dishwasher) and the part at the end of the plunger that pushes the meat out.  Unfortunately, replacement parts are not available for this item.",7
193,"I bought these cashews in a 48 count pkg & was disappointed in a few points. First the cashews were mainly pieces & few whole cashews & they were small in size.

195,"I thought these bars might be a good substitute for the Honey Nut Cherrios bar that I have for breakfast, I was wrong.<br /><br />Although they are both 40g bars the Cherrios bar is more filling.  They are about even on Calories but the Whenever Bar gets 80 of its 180 from fat, whereas the Cherrios bar gets only 35 of its 160 from fat.  The Whenever Bar has 15mg of Cholesterol, whereas the Cherrios bar has none.  The two bars are about even on Total Carbohydrates.<br /><br />To me this bar does not taste like Chocolate Chips - maybe that taste is overwhelmed by the heavy Coconut flavor.  If these were called Coconut bars, with a hint of Chocolate - maybe I would give them a higher rating - but, to me, the flavors are not as the product name would lead me to believe.<br /><br />I really was underwhelmed by this product, and unless you are a big Coconut fan, you probably want to buy something else.",2
196,I was hoping these would be better than chocolate Twizzlers but they taste like something entirely different.  Maybe its just me and they will appeal to others.  They do not taste like chocolate at least not to to me!  The service was great I got them in 48 hours. Kenny I am sure your other flavors are good - they just do not compare to the name brand or my tastes!,8
197,"I bought this based on review of all cocoa for Keurig brewers.  I have the model 70 and love it, but the Swiss miss really missed the mark.  I have yet to find a hot cocoa that we even like.  My kids actually dislike the flavor of the Swiss Miss.  When I tasted, I thought we bought the sugar free by mistake, but no - it stinks.  I wasted several k cups attempting to see if the size of the cup mattered.  Yuck.  We will just go back to packets and hot water for cocoa.  Someone has to break the hot cocoa barrier for k cups.",2
198,"While orange juice is the fourth ingredient in this drink,  the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is backed up by a low level of carbonation.  I think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients (tangerine is third) is what results in the unpleasant muddied orange taste. Finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail.  To my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely ""natural"" sugar in this or most any juice.  The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit.  Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.",4
199,"So these sticks taste ok, I mean, it's jerky, how do you mess that up? My issue is with the expiration date, which was a little less than one month from when I got my box. How am I supposed to eat 50 of these things in 25 some-odd days? That's just cheap trying to offload these so close to the expiration date. Never buying these again.",1
200,"Like other reviewers have said, this may take a short time for your dog to get used to. The dog learns to lick the roller ball and get to the juices. This may not be as satisfying a treat as doggy biscuits, but I can see this product being useful for training. For instance, if your dog pulls on the leash when you go for walks, stop and call the dog to you. If he listens, let him have a few licks before continuing. I can also see it being useful for dogs who are overweight and whose owners want to cut back on calories yet can still give the dog a little treat for good behavior.",15

205,"I'm assuming that most people reading this review have had Maruchan brand ramen noodes before so I don't feel the need to go into much general detail. I don't eat instant noodles too often (trying to go healthier!) but I was curious about these so I grabbed a couple packs.<br /><br />I'm a fan of chili peppers in curries and was curious how this was going to work out. Overall, it was underwhelming. The noodles are the same as always but the powder was kind of weird- after cooking I left the room to go do something and when I came back it had separated.  I didn't prepare it as per package instructions (I made it in the microwave instead with less water and didn't get it to full boiling, though I still added the powder after cooking) but it still seemed weird to me.<br /><br />As far as flavor, it was a kind of bland blanket spicy taste with a hint of chili powder. The spiciness is pretty strong (which I like) but I wanted more personality to it.<br /><br />I need to look at these at the grocery store and see if the salt content is a little lower than other flavors. It tasted like it might have been, and I'd be happy to trade lower sodium for a little less flavor.<br /><br />Overall, I'd prefer pork or creamy chicken flavor. But it's not nasty and it's definitely not as horrible as that time I tried cheese flavored cup ramen.",4
206,I love these orange cakes but I think they're overpriced. We can always get away with Nutella instead ... Maybe if more people buy it they could drive the price down.,2
207,"Strong stuff here. Not for the novice by any means. This product should be taken with LOTS of caution. For someone who is an avid exercise enthusiast and not sensitive to caffein in the least, one whole scoop will do fine. For the individual looking for a little boost, half a scoop or less in a small amount of water is fine. I gave this product 3 stars only because I think it could be dangerous to those who are expecting a little boost to help with their exercise program and aren't aware of the 200+mg's of caffeine. Take at your own risk.<br /><br />On the positive side, it gets the job done! Great focus and energy throuout.",4
208,"While I do like this product I must say it is NOT for the person looking for something that is a delicate ginger flavor. You MIGHT get that if you just run hot water over the bag and not let it actually steep in the mug. I went by the directions that say steep 5 to 10 minutes and boy I wish I had not done so! It was so strong that instead of fighting migraine like ginger is supposed to, it made it worse for a little while. I suggest if you want something light in ginger flavor that you go for sweet ginger peach instead of this product. If you want STRONG knock you off your chair ginger flavor that feels like a kick in the face, get this one.",4
209,"My daughter did not like this flavor, she will eat it with a little bit of vegetable or fruit puree every other bite.  It is a bit of a struggle, and honestly it is a strong fishy smell coming out of the package.  This is also a chunkier and drier pouch compared to the other flavors.",6
210,The packaging is rather painful to open.  They should design these with parents of new babies in mind.  Most food products with peel tops have one corner which is indicated as the side to open and the hard plastic has a crack allowing for the user to easily bend and peel the top.  No such luck with these tubs of baby food from Gerber.  It's not clear which side should be opened by the packaging and whichever one you choose will be equally stubborn before you can finally peel the top and feed your hungry baby.,7
211,"I had high expectations for these cookies but they weren't quite as good as I anticipated.<br /><br />They are very chewy and fresh-tasting -- that's the good news. But they're not exactly bursting with flavor and, as moist as they seem to the touch, they tasted dry as I ate them. My wife said the same, unprompted. I tried them with black coffee and they're just a bit gluey as you munch.<br /><br />If you want chocolate, this would not be a great choice. If you want something more akin to the mild taste of a scone, these individually-wrapped cookies would be okay if you don't mind the dryness.",8
212,"I've had the regular Oregon Chai and I really loved it.  Decided to try a 'healthier' alternative with this.  I don't know how using Splenda to sweeten it changed it so much, because compared to the regular Oregon Chai, this Sugar-Free one is very watery and very sweet tasting.  I can't taste any of the spices in it at all, I even drank the stuff straight to check if it was the milk I was using.  After I've gotten through these 6 cartons I'm going back to regular Chai and just going to try to cut down on my consumption.",4

I'll finish off what I purchased, but I'll also be looking at other gums with xylitol.<br /><br />After chewing for a few seconds, I noticed the gum feels very small, which makes it less satisfying to chew. As a comparison, the tiny Trident gum I used to chew felt almost twice as large in my mouth as this Spry gum. Not a huge deal, but if you have a large mouth, you may need/want to chew two pieces at a time, which increases the cost.<br /><br />Good:<br />Contains more xylitol than some other gums, such as Trident.<br />Good flavor (while it lasts).<br /><br />Not so great:<br />Flavor lasts less than 30 seconds.

220,"I thought I was doing my kid a favor when I invested in a case of Earth's Best dinners.  Unfortunately, the second ingredient (after water) for all of these is....applesauce.  Or in the case of the ""Sweet Potato & Chicken"" variety, it's sweet potatoes, followed by apricot puree.<br /><br />After getting used to the sweetness of these (try 'em - they're like jam), it's difficult for kids to adjust to ""real"" food.  From now on, I'm going to stick with just pureeing home-cooked food.  It's a lot cheaper, too.",9
221,"I ordered chocolate, vanilla, and peach.  The peach is okay, but it is not my favorite.  The flavor is subtle and it doesn't end up being very sweet or peachy.

222,"We bought this coffee as a replacement for Lavazza Supercrema while my wife cannot drink caffeine, and found it of uneven quality. We use it for making espresso in a Saeco Odea Giro, which brews consistently high-quality espresso from the Supercrema beans. However, some of the espressos from this decaf were excellent while other brews had a bit of a weird taste. Whether it's due to the visible inhomogeneity of the beans, I cannot tell. Or maybe this coffee is for what it says: drip coffee. Either way, we'll keep looking for better espresso beans. :-)",16
223,"We bought the large ball for our power-chewing 30lb cattle dog mix, and this product was AWESOME for the first two weeks. She just chewed and chewed and was happy as can be, it kept her occupied for at least an hour each treat... but then she figured out how to pop the treats out (no joke, she wedges her tooth under the edge and just eases them out), now the treats barely last 15 minutes because she just chews a bit and swallows them. They're just too expensive to give her anymore. Luckily you can still shove small bits of dog food into the center, and she still plays with the ball but that game doesn't last very long either. Great product and really durable, as long as your dog doesn't outsmart it!",15
224,"They are very easy to make, and have a good flavor, which kids and I liked.  Only item I noted, was the scone was not normal scone density.  Scone should be dense and heavier almost like a biscuit, but this was lighter along line of a muffin.  I may just add Whyman frozen wild blueberries (get at most grocery stores) to a mix of Dassant Vanilla Scone mix (from amazon), which will give the amazing Blueberry taste I was looking for and the usual scone texture, which is what makes them so satisfying.",9

It tastes like chocolate milk with only a faint coffee flavor, and it has a cardboardy aftertaste.

I'm going to stick with the other flavor, but maybe someone who prefers a milder, more cocoa/milk than coffee flavor might prefer this.",16
227,"Our little dude has arthritis now and since this developed, we've had to move his litter box to the first floor of the house.  So, when I found that this stuff totally kills the odors, I grabbed a box since Tidy Cats had begun to fail in the odor task immensely.  Quite honestly, I've NEVER had a litter that completely, totally, without a trace, ridded the air of all kitty odors.  This stuff, hands down, is the BEST I've ever tried.  There's absolutely NO odor whatsoever!  It's just a bit weird how you just do not smell anythiing at all.  However, don't have your cat sitting there waiting while you're filling the box.  As good as this is at clumping, odor control, and great smell, it's TERRIBLE for dust!  It just blows all over the place and I actually have to turn on the fan in the bathroom to get rid of it.  Why they can't get this without the dust by now is beyond me.  But, if you live in a small space and need the odor control, this is your litter.  Just get out the Swiffer and be prepared to dust.  Recommend highly, but with the above condition.",15

It almost makes me gag.  I'll be going with Nutiva next time.",4
233,"This is okay.  You have to use more than is actually called for to get a good flavor and the ingredient list isn't anything to rave about, but in a pinch it's okay.  My main issue is the taste isn't worthy the high calories in the least.  The coffee flavor is also pretty nonexistent.",9
234,"Avoderm salmon and chicken did not appeal to my finicky cats, but neither did the plain Avoderm salmon in consomme  (Wild by Nature) either. Since they gobble up the other flavors of Avoderm canned food which make up the bulk of their diet,, I am putting their rejection of this product down to their personal dislike of salmon rather than to any fault of the manufacturer. I have been feeding Avoderm to them for several months and they prefer it to any other brand of canned natural cat food.( and I have tried them ALL!) They are both pictures of good health...luxurious shiny coats with minimal shedding and no dandruff, bright clear eyes, and plenty of energy...which can't be caused by anything else but the Avoderm I feed them ! Highly recommend their canned cat food, so don't let my kittys' personal tastes affect your choice. Avoderm makes a great product!",6
235,"This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a ""half diet"" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.",4
236,"Yes I have eaten organics before, the brown color has no effect on me whatsoever........... but, these taste more like big fluffy raisins, not apricots.  There's a hint of 'cot, but there is more 'cot in Apricot Pyramid Beer than these.  That said, they are what they are and they are great for regularity and great to send as gifts - dried California organic fruit.<br /><br />I should say I am used to slab 'cots from casa de fruta, and these do not resemble in any way those dried 'cots even though they use sulfur dioxide, they are juicier and sweeter and taste like apricots.  Even Casa de Fruta's basic 'cots taste better than these.  I ordered on subscription, but will cancel today and have at least 4-6 gifts for Christmas already.",4
237,"The nutrition quality on this food isn't good enough that I would be happy actually feeding it to my dog as her primary food source. She does seem to like it, though, so I've been giving it to her a little at a time as a snack when I need her to eat just a little bit of something. Since it's different from what she usually gets, she seems to think of it more as a treat and she'll munch on it when she might ignore her regular food.<br /><br />The way it's packaged is nice, particularly due to the resealable zipper.<br /><br />In short, if I were actually treating this as a primary part of a dog's diet, it would be two stars at most. As an addition to my dog's diet in small quantities, she's willing to eat it in spite of being very very picky, so I'll bump it up to three.<br /><br />If you're actually looking for a primary food for your dog, on the other hand, I would definitely suggest looking for something that doesn't have corn as its first ingredient, doubly so if there's any sign your dog might have an allergy (skin irritations, frequent ear infections, that kind of thing).",11
238,"I am a fan of strong coffee and I really enjoyed Emeril's Big Easy k-cups, but this version has a pretty bitter aftertaste.  I'm guessing it's because it's decaf, as I'm having trouble finding a good decaf k-cup.  So I guess for a decaf it's okay if you like strong Starbucks-like coffee, but I'm going to keep trying to find one that's not so bitter before buying this again.",16
239,"This package of Marley coffee contains a bunch of ""pods"" designed for pod coffee makers. Look them up and boggle at the prices. I do not have one so my first try was with my French press - the purest way of making coffee. I put one pod into it and poured in a large cupful of almost boiling water. After poking it around for a while and leaving it to sit, I got a blackish coffee which tasted a bit weak.<br /><br />For my second attempt I cut open two pods and emptied the ground coffee into the press. The resulting coffee was quite strong, but as a quasi-European (English) that's the way I like it.<br /><br />What to say about the flavor? It was mild (no harshness) and fairly pleasant. The coffee in Denny's restaurants is better though.",16
240,"I love the Shin Ramyun flavor of ramen, and bought these because, unlike the bowls, the description for these said ""Boil or microwavable,"" and I assumed that meant you can either pour in boiling water, or pour water in and then microwave it.  This is NOT the case.<br /><br />I recommend getting the 4.2 ounce packages, as that is the more cost effective way to do it.  As always, keep an eye open for coupon codes or subscribe and save discounts.  Maybe check the googles.",0
241,"When I first bought my new espresso machine, I thought I'd get ESE pods to make the espresso-making a bit easier and less messy.<br /><br />That's exactly what I got: the pods are easy to use, and make a decent shot of espresso.<br /><br />Then I started using Lavazza and Illy pre-ground coffees, and grinding my own. The resultant espresso is a solid amount better because you can much more finely adjust the dose and tamp - how much coffee goes into the portafilter, and  how hard you smush the coffee into the portafilter. Pre-ground or whole bean espresso is also a fair bit cheaper than the pods.<br /><br />So, if you want a *decent* shot of espresso, with no mess or fuss, go with the pods. If you are willing to put in a bit of effort, though, you can get better espresso at a lower price.<br /><br />As far as the pods go, the Gran Crema are the best I've tried.",14
242,"I was in a hurry.  Based on the part of the label I could read from the web site I thought I was buying 100% pure pom juice.  If you read all the verbage you will see this is just another blend of other juices.  It tastes like apple/pear/pom, in that order, not 100% pom juice.  I have been mixing this 50/50 with 100% pure pom juice just to get rid of the case I bought.  Mixed this way it tastes just fine, but if you are looking for 100% pom juice, keep looking 'cause this isn't it.  This company does make a 100% juice which is what I thought I was buying, as the labels are very similar.  Their 100% juice is great, but cost more.",4
243,"I love ginger and dark chocolate, so I was excited to try these cookies.  When I received them, I did what I always do with a new food product:  I looked at the nutritional info.  Unfortunately, it is written European style, so the amounts are NOT listed per serving size; in fact, a serving size is not even given.  Values are per 100 grams, and the package is 125 grams total, with 8 cookies in the package...that is quite a lot of math!  However, to the best of my ability, that means each cookie has about 92 calories, 4.2 grams fat (2 grams saturated), 13.1 grams carbohydrates, and 8.1 grams sugar.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed in the texture of these cookies.  First, they were crumbly and stuck together in the package, which was a bit messy.  Second, they seemed to have lost their firmness, like a cookie that is past its freshness.  The taste itself wasn't bad:  the dark chocolate--which covers half the cookie, in a dipped fashion--was good, and the cookie part had a nice flavor, although there was only a very slight hint of ginger; as a ginger lover, I would have appreciated a much stronger bite.<br /><br />Overall, I found these cookies to be just okay.  Perhaps they would be better purchasing them fresh from the grocery store, but I would not order them myself online.",2
244,"Besides that mentioned in the title, the only other remarks I have about it is the price is hard to beat, the taste is akin to a Flintstone strawberry vitamin (for those of you that have tasted them), and taste lasts for not very long.  I'd say, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a 3.  Also, the taste really diminishes to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time.",4
245,"The flavoring is pretty strong, which is fine, except that I think it overwhelms the coffee a bit.  I like caramel, and I like vanilla, but one or the other (or maybe both) are a little too much in this product.",16
246,"I have three cats, one is 12 years old (Fred), one is 9 years old (Jewel) and a kitten that is 4 months old (Angel).  The kitten is very finicky and was recently weaned off her milk; the other two will eat almost anything.<br /><br />I first served the 'Chicken Pot Pie' flavor to the cats.  Visually, the canned food looks very appealing to me.  The look and smell is very similar to chicken pot pie - real pieces of shredded white meat chicken in a savory sauce.  The food was not watery at all; more like the consistency of a store bought frozen chicken pot pie filling.<br /><br />The kitten refused to eat the Chicken Pot Pie.  Fred licked a tiny amount and ran away.  No amount of coaxing him could get him to return for another taste.  Jewel licked away at the juices but did not eat the meat, which is typical for her.  She later returned to nibble some more but did not seem overly satisfied.<br /><br />Overall, I would call the Chicken Pot Pie a failure as nearly 60% of it was left in the bowl.<br /><br />Next up was the Sesame Chicken.  Suspicious, I read the label and was surprised to find that there were no organ meats, no denatured meat byproducts and no wheat gluten.  It is not made in China.  It looked good and smelled pretty good too...<br /><br />Again, the kitten refused to touch it.  She is very particular about what she eats, so this is understandable.  This time, Fred ate about 1/3 of it and Jewel did not want anything to do with it.<br /><br />Although the ingredients, nutrition and place of origin are important, in the end, it all comes down to whether my cats will eat the food.  I was disappointed that my cats did not care for this food.<br /><br />I must say, however, that cats are very particular animals.  Even though my cats did not like it, your cats might devour it in an instant.  As for quality, I give this food high marks.  It looks edible and smells like real food.<br /><br />Bottom line - I would recommend purchasing a sample before you go out and get a whole box.",9
247,"Wow!  You get a boat load of this stuff for the price.  I love this tea or at least I did when I first tried it.  It has a very effervescent, gingery kinda taste.  Now I think my taste buds have gone numb to the stuff.  And it's about 80 calories per cup, which is way too much for a cup of tea...really.  So I will probably use it only once in a blue moon.  But, no worries, each tea bag is nicely sealed in an aluminum paper-like bag which are all then sealed again in a larger aluminum paper-like bag.  I'm tell'in you this stuff could last through the Great Tribulation and still be fresh.",4

Actually, after I ate the whole pack I was still hungry.  Each piece is really about the size of a Starburst candy so my personal vibe was that eating a few tiny squares wouldn't be giving me any extra energy on top of all the other coffees, (diet) red bulls, and cliff bars I frequently consume.<br /><br />  They did taste pretty natural and I could taste the honey.  I might eat them again for a sweet tooth fix but at $1+ per pack and non-filling I'll probably stick to cliff bars and just secretly raid my office neighbor's starburst jar for a sweet tooth fix here and there.  Overall I give 3 stars out of 5 in consideration of price/value and other alternatives out there.",4

These dried onions taste as good as potato chips [organic, no salt added] and you would be willing to eat this product by itself without any other food.  However, I'm very concerned that the healthful phytochemicals in these onions have been severely damaged and mostly lost.  The ""sting"" in these onions is completely missing, indicating to me that Frontier either used ""sweet"" white onions deprived of sulfur instead of the organosulfur-rich regular white onions - or - Frontier dried regular white onions in a way that destroys too much of the highly beneficial phytochemicals.  The fact that the product we actually receive has been chopped up too finely instead of the nice, large chunks that we see in the photo also increases the odds that the healthfulness has been damaged.",8
260,"As a kid I grew up picking and eating my own oranges, mangoes, bananas, watermelon other tropical fruits.  I know what 100% natural fruit and juice tastes like.  This product does not taste natural.  If watermelon flavor had been absent I don't think I could differentiate this product from a strawberry soda you can get from any vending machine.  Moreover I am not crazy about carbonated drinks considering the current discussion about certain negative side effects that may be caused by carbonation in general.  You really can't put fresh fruit in a canned drink.  For those of you who are interested in a nutritious fruit drink that is good for you, take some frozen grapes, strawberries or cherries and put them in a smoothie blender.  Add some grape juice, apple juice, cranberry juice or whatever you have (that is 100% fruit product), some pineapple (if you like), a banana (if you want some thickness) and some ice.  Blend and then pour in a nice ice cold glass and enjoy!  Now this is 100% naturally good for you.  Nice try Switch - but I'd rather switch.",4

If you can't give up real peanut butter, then don't buy this product. But if you have 90-100 lbs or more to lose like me, and you love the peanut taste, then this Peanut Spread might work for you.

272,"Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is very easy to use. To prepare it you remove the strainer lid and sauce tray, add water, and put the strainer lid back on. You then microwave the bowl on high for 3 minutes and 30 seconds, letting it stand for one minute after heating. Then you drain the pasta with the handy strainer lid and heat the sauce in the microwave for 30 seconds on high. When it is finished you mix and serve. The instructions are easy to understand and everything in the package is clearly labeled. You have a nice convenient meal in about five minutes.<br /><br />Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is a good choice when you need a quick meal. It needs no refrigeration and has a long shelf life so it's a good item to stock up on. It is very tasty if a bit too spicy as the spices left a bit of an aftertaste. Because it is a single serving, it is not really for families at dinnertime - it is better suited as lunch, to eat after the gym, or for a single person. In fact, because it doesn't need refrigeration, it is a perfect lunch for people that work in an office, provided there is a sink nearby to drain the pasta. Because everything is contained in one package, cleaning is minimal - all you have to do is rinse out the containers to place in the recycling bin.<br /><br />While Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is a healthy meal alternative there are a few things to be aware of. The meal has 340 calories - 50 calories are from fat. There is no Trans fat, but the saturated fat is 10% of the Daily Value and the cholesterol is 7% of the Daily Value. As with all prepared meals, the sodium content is high - 25% of the Daily Value.<br /><br />Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is a convenient choice when you are pressed for time and not fussy about the type of sauce you use. However, it might be cheaper to buy your own pasta instead.",9

274,"I am sadly disappointed with this product. I think I got a bad batch, becaused I have purchased and enjoyed Sun Butter for a number of years. I have tried the Creamy Sun Butter and the the Organic and Natural Sun Butter before and really liked them and far prefer them over Peanut Butter, Almond Butter and all other nut butters. For some reason this batch has almost no flavor at all. In the past I have found Sun Butter to have a subtle sunflower flavor that I have really enjoyed. The texture is very much like peanut butter, of course, but sunflowers are much healthier and better for you than peanuts are. I checked the expiration dates on this batch of six bottles and none are expired, and all are sealed.... so I have no idea at all why they don't taste at all like the Sun Butter I have enjoyed for maybe 5-6 years now. I really can't blame Amazon. They offered them at a good price.  These six bottles came packaged from the manufacturer.... so I just don't know what the deal is. I have only opened the first one too.... which means I still have five more to choke down.  Disappointed, but not because of the brand necessarily. I think I must have received a bad batch. An UPDATE: I recently purchased a bottle of Sun Butter ""Natural"" to mix with the Creamy butter style. As the Natural version separates the sunflower butter and oil it tends to be smoother. When mixed 50/50 it made a much better Sun Butter. To anyone looking to buy, I'd recommend the Natural style.",12
275,"Like some of the other reviewers, I like to eat nutrition bars for breakfast, or as a quick snack.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these bars taste pretty bad to me. And the nutrition value doesn't make up for the poor taste.<br /><br />They have only 4g of protein and a lot of sugar, so they don't make for a very filling breakfast. Also they are very dry, need to have a drink when you eat them, so that makes a poor choice for a on-the-go snack too.<br /><br />I thought it was OK as pre-workout, perhaps because of the sugar giving me a little energy boost... but still, I'd rather just eat a cookie if I want a sugar spike.<br /><br />Also, the Orange Cranberry flavor has no noticeable cranberries or cranberry taste. Though it does have a strong orange flavor, it tastes like orange extract, a little bitter and tangy.",4
276,"I loved the Chai Tea Latte pods for the Nescafe Dolce Gusto machine, so this was one of the first flavors I bought for our new Keurig machine. What a let down. There is a distinct chemical after taste with the Cafe Escapes version. Add to that the fake sweetener taste amd I can't drink this at all. I added milk and some real sugar, but still the chemical aftertaste existed. Bottome line is that while breweing this Chai Latte smells wonderful, but if you are at all sensative to the chemicals used in artificial flavoring & fake sweeteners, then avoid this brand's version of the Chai tea.",4
277,"I have a dachshund/terrier mix who is 2 years old. I bought him the Busy Buddy for the same reason everyone else probably does: he needed more mental stimulation. I brought the toy home, loaded it up, and offered it to my dog. He quickly figured out the rope was restricting the flow of treats. He promptly chewed through the rope, leaving a knot in the bottom of the bottle and the rest of the rope and other knot on the floor. Without this restriction he figured out (within a matter of minutes) that if he threw the bottle into the air, the bottle would bounce, sending a treat or two flying out of the mouth and onto the floor. It should also be noted that this toy IS breakable.

280,"My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me a bit of the ""Shasta Black Cherry"" soda that I drank occasionally as a kid, although nowhere near as carbonated. Unlike the ""Shasta Black Cherry,"" this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 130 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product.<br /><br />If they created 12 ounce cans and lowered the price, then I would be more apt to purchase this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series.",4

282,"The Planters big nut bars are ok. They aren't too sweet, and actually I would have liked them to be just a little sweeter. They were not as crunchy as I thought they would be for having nuts in them. It could use more nuts than what are in them. I thought they were a bit bland tasting myself, but then again, different people have different tastes. I had my husband and my 10 year old try them. My husband really liked them as he is a HUGE peanut eater. My 10 year old liked them, but said she would only want one once in a great while. I agree with my daughter in the fact I wouldn't want them too often either. So, while they may be good for a quick snack they probably would not be something I would buy very often. They would probably be good to pack for a camping trip for a special treat.",8

285,"I'm not a granola expert of fanatic, but I thought I might enjoy this product more because I like blueberry and vanilla.<br /><br />When I opened it, it smelled musty, like a year-old box of cereal.  I found that very odd, but plunged ahead anyway.  It was disappointing, because I picked up on pretty much no blueberry flavor (or blueberries, for that matter).  It tasted like really dense granola.  From a pure flavor and eating enjoyment aspect, I did not really care for it.<br /><br />From a health standpoint, this product is free of everything ""bad"" and full of ""good stuff""...heavy on flax.  I'm not a health food fanatic, so again, this was lost on me.  But my son, age 24, really seemed to enjoy it.  He's much more attentive to what he consumes, and I think he liked the taste as well.  He ended up being the only consumer of this product.  (My wife liked it less than me.)<br /><br />I have to conclude, based on the non-scientific study of my family, that this product appeals to folks accustomed to more ""healthy"" snack foods...and not folks like me who have no problem with more ""commercial, processed"" snacks.

286,"I tried to post this on the Aerogarden official website, but I doubt it will be approved. It seems they only approve the reviews in which consumers rave on and on about the wonderful qualities of the Aerogarden. My review is meant to reflect my personal experience, which is neither all good or all bad. I just want to be realistic...<br /><br />""Though I do enjoy my Aerogarden, someone needs to come out and say that it's not quite as simple as just sitting back and watching your herbs grow. It requires a lot of careful pruning and there is a certain art to getting everything to grow properly.<br /><br />This is my second Aerogarden, and compared to the first, it was far more successful. In my first garden (the gourmet herbs kit), I was able to keep only the two Basils and Mint alive. This time, I was able to harvest herbs from four out of seven pods. The problem (for me) is that the basil, mint, and parsley grow so much faster than the other herbs that you have to prune them half to death in order to allow slower-growing herbs a chance to get a foothold before there just isn't enough light or room for them to grow. The savory and oregano seedlings got so leggy right away that they just flopped over and never really grew properly. Eventually, it became clear that they'd never grow enough to be worth anything, so I stopped my aggressive pruning and decided to just enjoy the basil, mint, and parsley. Don't know if I'm doing something wrong. I am an avid (outdoor) gardener and I consider myself pretty plant-savvy. I'm going to try again and hope for better results.<br /><br />I'd also like to say that the Aerogarden company does excel in the customer service department. When a couple of my pods failed to sprout, they sent replacements -- no questions asked. They also were willing to impart very good advice and didn't even keep me on hold for very long. I'll keep aero-gardening for some time, even if my yields aren't quite what I feel they should be.""",15

If i were reading this, I'd think I was dumb too, who orders 2.5lbs of a product (normally used in small quantities) without tasting it first? I know, I know.  I'm an idiot.<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />I know this is raw, and I'm not calling the Sunfood folks liars, I'm sure it is, and I've bought and liked a number of their other branded products (from their website), but: this has a very bitter taste to it that sort of leaves the overall impression of burntness/ashiness as the flavor.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty intensely cacao-y, but it's also flat and harsh at the same time.<br /><br />And no, I'm not confusing raw cacao powder with cocoa or sweetened cacao or any other thing.  I've tried 5 other brands of raw cacao powder and liked them all, to varying degrees (8-10 on a love scale).  We were going through about 8-12oz a week in our green smoothies so I thought I'd go with this to try and save some money, and since I'd liked every other brand we'd tried, I didn't think anything of buying a huge quantity of a brand I hadn't tried. Now I know better!! I'd put this closer to a 3-4 on a scale of 1-10.  It's OK to use in very small quantities to impart a vaguely chocolatey flavor (like a teaspoon in pancake batter), but other than that, the bitter ashiness really rears its head.<br /><br />I'm so irritated with myself for buying this without trying it, that at this point we're basically just not having smoothies (and my morning banana-cacao smoothie was something to look forward to!)<br /><br />My guess is that in a month or so, we'll finally admit to ourselves that we threw money away, suck it up and just chuck it all.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that the Sunfood brand raw cacao powder is fattier and (therefore) more caloric than other brands.  I don't know if that has something to do with the flavor profile (doubtful though because raw cacao butter, which is the extracted fat, is neither bitter nor ashy).<br /><br />SO disappointed.",4

The majority of the crackers are crumbled into bits.  Schar tried to prevent this by wrapping the craker packages in corrugated cardboard, but it really doesn't do the job.  My kids still enjoy the tiny pieces but a good deal of it is just too small to eat, so I save it for breading or fillers (like in meatloaf).  Buying them on amazon is much cheaper than the other health food stores in my area, who charge between $6 and $9 dollars per package!  I buy these every few months from amazon and will continue to do so as they are also milk and egg-free, which I need.  I just wish they arrived in better condition, then I would give them 5 stars.",0

309,"This is pretty good smoked paprika... there are better ones out there but they tend to cost about 6-10 times what this does.  Unless you're just an occasional user, I couldn't justify going to the higher priced stuff.  This has an overall good flavor, no bitterness, not too smokey, and its level of smoke is very consistent.  I will definitely keep buying this.",4
310,"We were subscribed to this coffee until recently.  We got about a half-dozen boxes during our subscription.  The coffee is robust in flavor, and makes a tasty large cup.<br /><br />The only problem that we had was that, with one box, about half the box had coffee loose in the bottom part of the pods.  When you brewed the coffee, you'd get a cup full of wet grounds.  We found that if we checked the pods against the light, we could see which had loose coffee, and we could trim one corner to empty out the loose grounds.  There were still a few in each cup, but at least it was drinkable.<br /><br />Good coffee - it's a shame they canceled the subscription.<br /><br />K",16
311,"Do not confuse this product with the Irish steel cut oatmeal that must be cooked for 30 minutes. That is the best. This oatmeal is not as good, but for a quick cooking product, it is pretty amazing. You can have oatmeal ready in 5 minutes. This oatmeal is best with a little milk, some brown sugar, and some berries or dried fruit. I like dried dates and dried black figs combined in mine, but it is fun to experiment. It's hard to believe that something this good is also good for you.",2

314,"I've tried a number of different flavors and found the Bleu Cheese and Vinaigrette more suited to my taste.  Nothing I've tried of these dressings really tastes like normal salad dressing, but these make terrific alternatives if you're looking for a dressing that minimizes caloric intake.  The Vinaigrette also has made a good ""dipping"" dressing for bread, etc.  Just try a few and see which ones you like.",9
315,"I bought this because Amazon was out of the Two Leaves & a Bud Assam (which is my favorite).  This has a good clean flavor - slightly earthy, smokey, with some lighter notes (flowery?). Since it's whole leaf tea, I find it less bitter and has a fuller flavor than most bagged darjeeling tea. If you like a bold morning cup of black tea, this might not be the one for you.  However, it is lighter than the assam (or English/Irish breakfast types) and I prefer the darjeeling as an early afternoon tea.",16
316,"Opening the box, I got a good first impression: these tea bags have a pleasant aroma and are designed with a pyramid design to maximize their steeping power. But what really surprised me is how full-bodied and hearty this is for an herbal tea: a rich berry flavor tempered with notes of vanilla.  This is not some flowery, pantywaist tea - it's genuinely satisfying.  I'm more of a cold-weather hot tea drinker, and I can't wait to cozy up with a cup of this on a frosty winter day.",16
317,"I have been impressed with this dog food, that I started using when I saw it at a local feed store.  It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.  Too bad Amazon appears not to plan to carry this brand any longer.",11
318,"I was surprised at how well the rinds ""popped,"" and didn't have any difficulties as other reviewers did.  I made sure that I unfolded the package (it's folded into three just like a microwave popcorn pack), unbent the folds so that the product could move between the three areas, then I shook it vigorously several times, trying to distribute the contents somewhat evenly throughout the bag.  Two minutes in my microwave (1100 Watts, but 10 years old) is perfect, and virtually all rinds pop every time.<br /><br />This is a low fat product, so it isn't nearly as tasty as the supermarket pork rinds you may have tried.  One could easily eat an entire package, although there are three servings per bag, but you will pay the consequences in terms of salt intake and MSG overload.  The MSG triggered a migraine for me, so now I don't eat it frequently, and make sure I only consume half a bag at most.  When I get near the bottom of the bag, where the most salt and MSG ends up, I try to brush off as much as I can.<br /><br />Still, a good snack option for those with blood sugar sensitivities.  Zero carbs is always good! The only reason for my 4 star review is that the amount of MSG per bag seems to be pretty high, and that's not disclosed on the product's Amazon page.",4

323,I like these graham crackers because they have whole wheat which is very important to me.  The taste is ok because I add peanut butter to them.  I liked them better before they changed the recipe.  As long as they keep the 3 grams of fiber I will keep buying.  I feel they are the best of what's available.  Make sure you check the date when purchasing because they have no preservatives they get rancid quickly.,13
324,"I bought a 2-pack of the chicken flavored Everlasting Treats to see if my husky/g.shepherd puppy would like them. She ate the first one in one sitting. That wasn't very ""everlasting"" and at nearly $4/ea it was an expensive treat. The 2nd one she took 2 - 3 days to eat, so I decided I would buy more of them as an occasional treat. My next puchase included the treat ball and a couple of other flavors (Liver and Vanilla Mint). The ball definitely helped a lot in slowing down the consumption time of the treat and she enjoys playing with it.<br /><br />Two paws up!",11
325,"Disclosure:  I'm a tap water drinker at heart.  Give me a Camelback bottle and an hour in the refrigerator and I'll gladly drink our city water as is.  When I got the chance to try Essentia's purified, pH balanced water for review purposes, I jumped at it, mostly to find out what I was missing.  On balance, I like it better that tap water or some of the store bottled waters.  I'm probably too stingy to buy more myself, but if you think it would make the difference between drinking water and going without, I would highly recommend Essentia.<br /><br />Flavor:  Essentia is osmotically purified, then electrolytes* are added to mimic the subtle mineral flavors that you get with groundwater.  The result: A very clean water flavor, with an almost silky feel as you drink it.  The difference isn't huge -- it's all water, after all -- but it's definitely there, and it's definitely an improvement.<br /><br />pH Balance: As stated, this is pH balanced at 9.5.  I have to confess I haven't read anything on why you might want water this alkaline, and I didn't notice any difference while drinking it.  Still, if you're looking for an alkaline drink, this fits the bill.",4

329,"I have to get this for my son because it's the only one he likes.  I tried to get him the ""Bare Fruit"" chips which are in my opinion tastier and also made in the USA but they are definitely hard to eat for a 2 year old (plus the bag doesn't have a Mickey Mouse on it...sigh).  So, these are good and easy to eat and all is great if the severely faulty Chinese quality controls don't fail yet again.  It worries me that these come  from a country that has sent us deadly toys, deadly toothpaste, deadly baby formula, deadly dog food and treats, amongst many others, but hopefully he'll outgrow these ones quickly.",11

333,"I've been giving these to my 2 cats everyday after I give them wet food so that their teeth can be somewhat cleaned afterwards. They love the flavor, though after such a long time they're growing weary of the taste. It's well known that cats who eat too much wet food without eating anything crunchy after are prone to tooth decay. This is just one product that can help cut down on long-term dental health issues with your feline.<br /><br />The only downside to this product is that it only comes in 1 flavor; my cats want variety. Do yours?",11

The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is pretty good, although I haven't found a great number of cashews. I've had it in rather hot places and it does kind of lose its shape. That's annoying. Purchasing it through amazon.com was a breeze, I enjoyed having 12 at once and saving. This stuff is okay to buy in bulk because you can consume it so quickly.",8
336,"The bar is very tasty and has the protein I was looking for. A great product. I canceled just this month because the price went up by nearly $2. With shipping, a box now costs $14, which is still not bad compared to many other protein/nut bars on the market. Just a little too expensive for me.",0

342,"I discovered Tiger Chai a few years back at a little cafe, and have been enamoured with it's flavour ever since.  It's a bit of a far cry from either homemade chai or the more common instant ones (Morning Glory or Oregon), but it's really quite addicting.  I have to be careful not to drink more than 2 or 3 cups once I get started!<br /><br />The only drawback with this powder is the inclusion of the nasty, super-processed instant creamer.  They don't put enough of it in the mix to really make the product creamy at all - you have to still mix it with whole milk to really make it into chai.  However, you can still taste the awful artificial stuff.  It would be so nice to get a version without the instant creamer - you could add some milk and this would qualify for being hands-down the best instant chai on the market.<br /><br />Mixed with milk, it's still very good, but I don't recommend using just hot water.",4
343,"I enjoy whole-roasted coffee beans. Once you grind your own coffee you just can never go back to coffee in a can, or certainly not instant coffee. Well, whole bean coffees are expensive in a grocery store or supermarket. I've discovered a lower-cost alternative. I pick up two or three pound containers at Trader Joe's or Costco. The Costco source is particularly interesting in that they always seem to have two or three different kinds, but the kinds seem to change on every other visit. Over the years, I've had coffees from all over the world. This latest time there was a pallet of Kirkland Signature Dark Roast Espresso Blend (with a little tag that said roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co.) The aroma around the display was excellent and I couldn't resist.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the rich aroma was almost overwhelming. My wife even loved it and she isn't a coffee drinker. The coffee itself isn't all that impressive. It has a good light tasty flavor that seems mild and slightly sweet and goes down quite easily. I'd have to guess that the caffeine content was not up to the level I was used to in other whole-bean coffees and it doesn't provide that good morning jolt. I was expecting something richer and more robust, more like a dark roast. Well, this is a nice coffee, but if you're looking for something that will grow hair on your chest, this is not the one. It has a good flavor, but it's weak. I'll have no trouble finishing the bag, but I'm disappointed. The aroma was so promising and the coffee just wasn't up to it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",16
344,"I love this bar and that is probably because I love any treat that combines peanuts and chocolate.  I don't consider this a health bar.  This has a good amount of sugar and a good amount of fat.  I eat them because they are a great cheat treat.  When I eat well all day, I look forward to this soft but chewy bar that has real peanuts and what seems to be real chocolate (I detest bars that proclaim to have real chocolate but instead incorporate a fake chocolaty substance).<br /><br />What I like about this bar:<br />1) The taste - Wow! For a granola bar the taste is phenomenal. The picture on the box does not lie.  You can see peanuts and oats and the chocolate topping tastes awesome.  The texture of the oats/nuts melds well with the oats and nuts.<br /><br />2) Portable and easy to pack - If you try to stay aware of your daily calorie intake, it is always great to have easy to carry snacks with their calories clearly labeled. Who has time to count out the exact number of pretzels that comprise 150 calories? That is part of the appeal of a granola bar. You've got a 150 calorie food item that can be placed in a purse or coat pocket and you are out the door.<br /><br />3) The company has made a conscious effort to reduce packaging in order to reduce impact on the environment.  The box is made of 100% recycled materials.<br /><br />What is questionable about this bar:<br />1) This is a snack/treat bar and nothing else - This is not a healthful nutrition bar. The product packaging does not necessarily say this is healthful. It does use the words ""organic goodness"" and boasts ""9 grams of whole grains"". These notations may make some think this is a really healthy treat. But it's not. The bar has low fiber (2g) and pretty high sugar for a 150 calorie bar (11 grams).<br /><br />2)If you use snacks to hold you over, you probably should find a snack with at least 4 grams of fiber. The 2 gram bar is not going to tide you over very long.<br /><br />If you feed these to your kids, there is a good likelihood they will like them. They are pretty sweet.  But again with the sugar, what else are you giving your kids during the day? Four grams of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar. So you have about 2 and 3/4 teaspoons in this bar. With everything else your kids consume during the day, (chocolate milk? orange juice? sandwich with jam?), the sugar in this bar may not be worth it to you. Kids usually need 1200 to 1700 calories a day. While there is no prescribed amount of sugar for a kid during the day, I have read that the calories from added sugar should be limited to 10% which, on the low end, would translate to 7 teaspoons of sugar and 11 teaspoons on the high end.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Nature's Path has created a very tasty granola bar with quality ingredients. Props to the company for not saying this was a health or nutrition bar on the box. I am reviewing this as a treat bar and as a treat, it is a delicious option. If it were being reviewed for health, I would not be able to give it four stars as it has high sugar, high fat and low fiber.  Don't expect it to hold you over for hours but do expect it to satisfy your sweet tooth.<br /><br />These granola bars are made in the United States.",13

347,"Did some googling on kitten nutrition and found that the food I was feeding my kitten did not have very high water content and that she was supposed to be eating a meat based food (grain is no good for cats).  This food seemed to match well with what google told me, and I've been feeding her this wet food for 2 months now.  She seems to like the food and she looks great.  She seemed pretty healthy before as well, but there was a noticeable difference after I switched her food.  Her coat is shinier and softer, she's more energetic, and has been maintaining a good weight.  I wish it wasn't so expensive, but I think its worth the price and I will keep buying it.",11

Each 1/4th cup is 140 calories and contains 6 grams of sugar, so try not to get too carried away- you could do some serious damage to the bag in one sitting (it's that tasty).<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the amount of dark chocolate and red berries in the bag is actually very small.  You have to dig around for them.  If you buy this granola, be prepared for the lack of these treats.",8

It went quickly and we bought it again.<br /><br />I like it but I wouldn't consider it to be an every morning bowl of cereal. I much prefer a more hearty cereal with a little more substance.<br /><br />Krave makes for a fun snack and can take away that chocolatey craving. It's pretty dry and the chocolate inside is really some kind of a paste.<br /><br />I'd rate it moderate for nutritional content, pretty good for flavor. Not the best cereal by any means.",2

Anyway, this coffee is meant for Pod coffee makers - did not realize this when I requested the coffee.  I do not own a pod coffeemaker.  You get 15 individual pod packets.  Each pod holds a single serving/cup of coffee.  To enable brewing in my coffee maker, I just cut the pods open and dumped into a coffee filter, and voila!  Coffee has nice rich aroma, and it has a full flavor.  It's definitely a better coffee than I had been drinking, which was your basic old school supermarket stuff.  For reference, I am not someone who tolerates strong coffee well.  Starbucks can give me a panic attack!

375,"This arrived earlier than expected, which was great! However, for some reason, this particular product smelled a little like ""fish food"".... but no worries, still tasted like great cashew butter, just the smell was kinda weird - like fish food. Also, I wish this product was organic.",6
376,"I love these chips, which is why I bought them, to stock up for the entire school year. The chips taste great, and packages were all sealed and in good condition when the arrived. The box on the other hand was in tatters, with holes and complely squished... I don't know if that was a result of customs or the voyage, but to receive it was a bit disgruntling given it was falling apart. Luckily, there were no victims within. All the chips are as they should be.",8
377,We have been buying Ass Kickin Chili Fixins for a number of years and really like it.  We have used for gifts to friends who want our recipe.  WARNING: Use the ground habanero pepper packet sparingly.  We measured it out and only used 1/4 tsp. and our chili was plenty hot.  You can always add more but you can't take it out once you have it in the pot.  Sour Cream and cheese for toppings were perfect.,4
378,"I need to stay away from sugar and I don't want to drink chemical sweeteners.  This drink mix is OK if I use a little bit.  I mix 1 teaspoon (instead of the recommended 2 1/2) into a quart of water, and it makes it lightly fruity sweet. I have also used 1-2 teaspoons in place of half the sugar in Kool-aid.  I will buy it again and try other flavors, because I like to have some flavor in my water sometimes.",4
379,"Delicious well-balanced flavors.  Does not contain added citric acid, gluten or dairy ingredients so it works well for my allergies.  The only thing I would wish to change is the price; I wish it was a little cheaper.",13

I have had some traders joes no acid coffee that was good.(but not the dark roast.)But the one I liked, is no longer.<br />So I tried this from vine. praying for the beat<br />first I only recieved one pack, this is not a whine, just it hard to see if the coffee is workable more than once.<br />The one micro pot was great and tasted wonderful, no stomache ache. I may buy some more to see if its more than a one pot wonder.",16
383,"I love to eat this for breakfast in the summer, because it's light and good when you are watching your weight.  However, I personally find that for me, I have to add a banana to it or I'm hungry in a little over an hour.  It is a tiny bit bland in flavour, so I guess adding a banana is a good thing anyway because it gives it an extra flavour boost.<br />Overall, this is good for a light start to the day, but I think it's the type of cereal you'd get bored of if you ate it day after day after day.  I alterate this with either different cereals, or toast.",8
384,I start each day with a cup of hot chocolate.  I worried that this product was discontinued because I couldn't find it for some time.  But happily it became available again and I ordered enough to last a while.  I like the way it tastes and love the fact that it is like 30 calories per serving.  The low calorie count gives me more reasons to keep using it.,8
385,"Not much of a tea drinker, or hot beverage drinker for that matter, but I first discovered this brand/flavor at a Red Carpet Club in the LAX airport and have been trying to find it ever since.  It's a unique, smooth and pleasant flavor that requires no sweetening or sprucing up. Highly recommended.",4
386,"Better Than Bouillon is a line of ""concentrated paste food bases"" that includes three vegan options: vegetable, beef, and chicken (or rather ""no beef"" and ""no chicken""). The ""not bouillon"" comes in small, 8 ounce jars and requires refrigeration after opening. You use the paste much the same way you'd use bouillon - there instructions for use on the jar - but according to the manufacturer, the paste is supposed to result in a ""richer and more natural flavor"" than one can get from bouillon cubes.<br /><br />I've bought a jar of each to sample, but thus far have only tried the chicken flavor (to make vegan chicken noodle soup - of course!). While the broth is indeed delicious, I can't say that I prefer it over the vegan bouillon cubes I normally use (namely, Edward & Sons and Rapunzel brand, though I'm still shopping around). Since it comes in a semi-liquid form, it's also messier and less convenient to use than a traditional bouillon. From an environmental perspective, the jars mean more packaging and greater use of resources in shipping.<br /><br />On the positive side, none of Better Than Bouillon's vegan options contain palm oil, whereas both Edward & Sons and Rapunzel do. So bonus points for that!<br /><br />Use it to make vegan soups, gravy, rice, seasoned veggies, pasta sauce - whatever your heart (or tummy) desires. Just be sure to recycle that glass, people!",12
387,"The Xlylitol leaves your mouth feeling squeeky clean (kind of like the ""Orbit"" gum commercials make you think their gum feels like)!<br /><br />They really need to work on how to make the flavor last longer.<br /><br />I used to chew ""Extra, Sugar-Free"" gum and finally made the connection that whatever was 'in' it made my glands in my throat and my tonsils swell like I was getting a cold. I took some herbs and vitamins and the symptoms subsided, but EVERY time I put more gum back in my mouth, day after day, that my glands were seriously irritated or working hard at killing 'something'.<br /><br />I don't know what was wrong, but now, I will not touch ""Extra sugar-free gum"" again. I love this gum, even if the flavoring and texture does not last an 'extra, extra long time' ;-)",15

Gus is 11, and it also seems to me that he has more energy since he's been eating this food.  The last food I had him on was an IAMs brand.  I finally looked at the label and saw it had corn meal as the major ingredient.  Hmmm.  Figured that wasn't a natural doggie diet, so switched him to this.  Other than the fact that I can't find this food in any but the 4 lb. size, I am very happy with it.",11

391,"I am not a canned coffee drink person, but wanted to try this and I must say I was pleasantly surprised at the taste and consistency and the fact there was no aftertaste.  I did not drink it chilled. It was sitting on the kitchen counter - I was having a 'yawny' Sunday afternoon and decided to give it a try.  Maybe it was the power of suggestion or maybe it was the caffeine, or maybe a bit of both, but I actually did feel a bit refreshed after drinking it. No more yawns :)<br /><br />I have to be careful with the amount of sodium in a product and this contains 60 mg.  The sugar is 18 g. Carb 19g.  I would keep a few cans in the pantry for now and then, but for me, I would not drink one every day, but this would be my choice of canned coffee drink because I actually DID like it!",4

393,Kellogg's Special K Granola Bars-Dark Chocolate<br /><br />110 calories--Calories from Fat 25<br />Sodium is only 4% of daily values<br />17g carbs<br />4g protein<br /><br />This was a very tasty snack.  The chewy part is accurate which makes it easier to eat in the car.  The crunchy ones spray all down the front of your shirt when you are driving and eating.  This had a nice flavor and the dark chocolate flavor made it more candy bar-ish than many.<br /><br />I liked it and particularly like the low sodium.  I'm always amazed at how much sodium is in supposedly healthy foods.,8
394,I really enjoy drinking these. They help me get past my craving for a soda. They have a great flavor.,4

397,"I have two big cats (over 15 lbs each) and they eat mostly canned food.  I don't feed them dry food except as a treat.  Both cats come running when I shake the can.  They eat them up and beg for more.  OK, the packaging is excessive to say the least.  They come in a paint can when a plastic zip bag would easily suffice.  I'm taking a star away for the paint can which is only about 1/3 full when you put in the treats.",11

399,"Since it's summer and extremely hot outside, I expected these cookies to be very nearly melted when I opened the package.  But they were still perfectly intact.  And were not actually gooey at all.  The chocolate filling in them is soft and a little grainy as cooked chocolate tends to be.<br /><br />What I do love about these cookies is that the chocolate inside is dark chocolate.  In my experience, chocolate chip cookie fans like milk chocolate in their cookies.  I tend to prefer oatmeal and dark chocolate in my cookies--trick myself into feeling like it's a healthy cookie--but in most cookie crowds, my preference seems to be in the minority.  I am so glad the good people at Chips Ahoy see things the way I do.  Well, no oatmeal in there, but it is dark chocolate.<br /><br />They don't taste like fresh-baked cookies.  They are soft and moist, which is good, but they do taste packaged and preserved.  I guess that's not so shocking considering that they are actually packaged and preserved.  The cookies are small... I don't see a problem with that... as they are soft cookies; their size keeps them from crumbling under their own weight.<br /><br />I asked my 8-yr-old daughter to ""review"" these cookies.  I did use the word ""review.""  She said, ""They taste like cookies.  With extra chocolate.""  Then, feeling that a review should probably be more creative, she announced, ""It's like there are stars bursting in my mouth!!""  Yes, creative, but I have no idea what that is really supposed to mean.  Means she likes them I guess.",2

402,"After visiting a nutritionist, they recommended that I eat foods that were high in fiber and low in sugar.  I like Granola, but found that most Granola offerings were very high in sugar content.<br /><br />After researching lots of options, I found Bob's Red Mill Granola to be the right balance of fiber and sugar.  This is the only flavor I have tried so far, but the Apple and Blueberry flavor is delicious.<br /><br />So far, I have eaten this granola plain, with milk and mixed with yogurt.  Like all granola, if this sits in liquid too long it gets very mushy.  I don't like mushy very much, so I eat quickly after adding to milk or yogurt.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased and will be trying other flavors soon.",13
403,"Love the taste, first off!  I have only tried the vanilla flavor and it has been wonderful.  The idea behind me taking this protein drink is actually two-fold.  The first is to not eliminate but lower my coffee drinking addiciton (i.e. starbucks use ot be a morning ritual!) and also because it has some calories but not too many, I've been using it as a meal replacement for breakfast time.  I'm trying to lose weight, and this is helping me get closer to my goal weight.<br /><br />Since each serving is only 100 calories, you should be prepared for that you will feel hungry about an hour after you drink it.  I started taking Yohimbine Powder, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005XOUOA4"">5 Grams Yohimbine HCL 99% Bulk Powder</a> shortly after starting to drink these shakes, and if you are trying to cut back on calories, I highly recommend some kind of natural appetite suppressant, you have no idea the difference it makes, basically a life-saver for me as I'm what you would call a snacker of snacks!<br /><br />I know some other reviewers have said that stiring the mix works for them but I'm sorry if you really want to enjoy this shake, you need a blender, plain and simple.  I could sit there in my kitchen and stir for an hour and it still won't taste nearly as good compared to blending it for thirty seconds.",4

Of all the thousands of dollars I've spent with them, this Assam Bukhail estate tea is in my opinion the best investment they offer in tea drinking pleasure.  NO morning tea I ever drank comes close to this tea.  Refreshing, bracing, full of deep full flavor and a so full bodied, I can't imagine life anymore without a cup of this surpassing tea.  If you are a fan of breakfast teas, I think you'll agree this is the best there is!",16
420,"I have been happy with the Neuro brand drinks since I tried them the first time at a deli in Manhattan.  I bought a stray Sonic and Sleep or two a few times to help me study and sleep and found them both to be very effective.<br /><br />I am a medical student in the middle of my clerkship year with an old habit of sleeping at very odd hours that really do not match up with my clinic schedule.  When I feel groggy and crabby after getting too little sleep, getting up early, and then having to stand quietly through a 4hr surgery, lecture, or conference, a Neuro Sonic at lunchtime totally gets me ready for the rest of the day when beforehand all my body wants to do is crash.<br /><br />Also, regarding the taste (I read the 1* reviews that complained about it), I find it to be very tasty, but then again I like the taste of Red Bull too.  The two don't taste alike really as Sonic is sweeter with a little more fruit flavor to it, but it's a similar type of 'energy drink' phenomenon where the taste isn't 100% like snapple or orange soda.  Bottom line is that if you're interested pick a single up somewhere and give it a try -- like I said I personally find the taste refreshing so there's more than one opinion out there.  I came here to order a case because buying singles is somewhat of a hassle and I'd rather have them ready to go in the fridge.  It kind of stinks that I can't get them at my local grocery yet, and for cheaper than $30 no less, but I like the product so okay.",4

There is plenty of fruit in both this and the Sunrise Fruits version of Flahavan's oats.  I make mine with half a cup of milk and half a cup of water for each half a cup of oatmeal (package directions), and it's just delicious.  There is enough cinnamon to beautifully flavour the oats without being overpowering, and the apple flavour really complements it perfectly.  Lovely oatmeal - best I've ever had.",2
424,"The Switch is an alternative to juice or soda... It is a sparkling juice made with a concentrated juice blend, reconstituted to fresh juice concentration with sparkling, filtered water.<br /><br />I tried both this and the Kiwi Berry flavors and I have to say that Black Cherry is by far the more accurate and rich flavor... I am a big Dr. Brown's soda fan and think Dr. Brown's makes the best Black Cherry soda, but if I had to choose a favorite (and not a diet favorite, a full carb version) I would choose The Switch. The flavor is much deeper, and fresh...<br /><br />The Switch does have as many carbs as regular sodas, as it is juice...It's important to remember that juice and regular soda both have sugar- just different types.  The Switch is very sweet, this is full power juice, not sparkling water with a meager splash of juice.<br /><br />I think this would be a great alternative to traditional soda/pop for kids (on special occasions of course) and it is definitely like a more sophisticated soda/sparkling beverage for adults...<br /><br />Yummy stuff. Not an everyday beverage for me as I watch my carb intake (due to type 1 diabetes) but this could be worked into many different types of meal plans...",4

It's the only herbal tea I've found that is naturally sweet so you don't have to add sugar or sweeteners. The aroma is heavenly and as an added bonus, it acts as an appetite suppressant (at least for me) because when you're inhaling that scent your palate doesn't crave anything else.

The brewed tea flavor is clean and yet complex, slightly rich. There is a an very slight edge of tannin which perfectly contrasts the subtle woodsy and floral flavors. Excellent with a dash of cream. Unfortunately Numi does not list the amount of caffeine it contains on the box. It appears to have less caffeine than the usual English breakfast from its effect on this taster.<br /><br />Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging. The boxes containing their tea is made from 100% recycled paperboard from 100% post-consumer waste--they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2,040 trees, reduce landfill by 131,200, and prevent 184,000 greenhouse emissions.

447,"These treats are 100% beef liver--nothing else. You can't ask for anything healthier than that! Just don't overfeed them. They're treats, not food. Remember that. Your dog would prefer you forget that distinction, because he will love them that much. If you have a small white dog you are probably familiar with the red eye stains. Most people don't know that adding liver to their diet every day will get rid of that ugly stain. Don't exceed the recommended amount. The stain that's already there won't go away, it will have to grow out and be trimmed away by your groomer. But in a few weeks you should notice that white hair is growing in at the base of the old stains.",11
448,"I love Earth's Best products (except their diapers, they are very hard and stiff and seem uncomfortable for my baby) and this isn't an exception. Baby doesn't really like it but we keep trying because babies tastes change. I only buy Earth's best babyfood and the thick consistency is much better than Gerber's stage 3 veggies.",9
449,These beans arrived in a vacuum sealed package.  They were soft and fragrant and perfect for making our own vanilla extract.  I have the beans marinating and can't wait for the vanilla to be ready.  Shipping was super fast.  Will be making ice cream soon with fresh vanilla.,14
450,"I found these because my Trader Joe's was out of their Pita Bite crackers every time I went in there. These are exactly the same ones. I top mine with mozzarella and bruschetta. The only negative comment is that there were very few whole crackers out of all the boxes, most were pretty broken up. Tastes the same, though!",7
451,"These are really delicious. The overall taste is mostly peanuts and sunflower seeds, then you get little bursts of tartness from the fruit in the bar. I've already ordered more. Kids will love them, but even my very conservative Aunt took some to use as a no-cholesterol breakfast. These bars are completely vegan and there's nothing in them you'd hesitate to give your family. These will be a regular purchase for me and I'm planning to try their other flavors, too.",2
452,"The raw nuts and fruits in these bars make them as close to nature as anything you will find in a wrapper. The Larabar reminds me of the naturally zesty and sweet fruit rolls I used to eat as a kid but also has wonderful, flavorfull fresh nuts mixed in. Raw nuts contain healthy fats and the protein and fat in the nuts will lower the glycemic index of the food. If you don't want to lug around raw cherries and a snack bag of raw nuts, this is the convenient alternative.<br /><br />Keep in mind, these are excellent treats for pets too. They are especially nice for birds who like to pick at the dried fruit and munch on the raw nuts. If you are going to offer these to a pet, please check the ingredients to be sure they are compatible with your species of pet.",2
453,"This is the best jerky I've ever had, and I'm so sad my grocery store doesn't carry it anymore. I have to buy it online now. The texture is perfect, not too chewy, not too tough, and the teriaki flavoring is perfect as well, not too overpowering, but tasty and well-balanced in flavor. The only downside is I can't stop eating it!",8
454,"We all know there are good and bad gluten free products out there.  Rarely do you find one that is GREAT!  This product far exceeded my expectations.  The result was a soft, and most importantly delicious cookie.  I would be proud to serve these to guests, gluten free or not.  Best of all, I've tried these several times, and they turn out perfect every time!",13
455,My boys and I love these cookies!  These are some of my favorite gluten free cookies...I couldn't stop snitching them from my kids (they are the ones with Celiac).  The packaging makes them perfect for snacking.,2
456,"I absolutely LOVE these breakfast bars.  High in fiber and fortified with many vitamins, ""Banana Bread"" is the only flavor that's really yummy.  Unfortunately, no stores in my area carry this flavor anymore.  I was prepared to pay an arm and a leg to buy them online, but right now (July 2010) the only purchase option here at Amazon is twice the price for the product that I am accustomed to paying AND the shipping is an ARM AND A LEG at 11 dollars.  Come on, guys, you can do SO much better.  :-(",0
457,"This is great for kids AND adults! Made with healthy ingredients and much better than snacking on candy bars! I take mine to the movies, packed lunch, trips, wherever! When I found out I could buy these in bulk from Amazon and SAVE money - I was happy. I will be sure to try the other varieties as well!",8
458,HAPPY WITH DELIVERY OF THESE JAWBREAKERS. THE 30 LB BOX LASTS FOR MONTHS. THE CANDY IS GREAT THEY ARE VERY GOOD TASTING AND ENJOYABLE. I HAVE THEM ON REGULAR SCHEDULED DELIVERIES YOU SAVE MONEY THAT WAY. MY HUSBAND TAKES THEM TO WORK AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO VISIT HIS DESK ARE DELIGHTED WITH THEM. IF YOU WANT A GOOD TASTING HARD CANDY THEN THESE ARE PERFECT.,5
459,Our order arrived yesterday and this morning we placed an order for more - the taste is addictive!!  Just enough punch and spice.,5
460,"I've recently gotten into health drinks (Emergen-C and ZipFizz, etc...). This stuff is a little expensive but I got it with the 15% discount. Without a doubt I had more energy while working out the first time I tried it - I burned 100 more calories than I usually do on the treadmill and afterwards felt like I had never gone running in the first place. I've used it a few more times since then and this stuff is great. I'm no health expert but I have already recommended this stuff to several siblings and friends. Everyone I've told about it (gave them a free pack) liked it a lot and got their own.<br /><br />Try it out for yourself. I take it 30 mins before I workout.",15
461,"I love the taste and smell of butter in my cooking. This is really a good product, without the added salt. It flavors vegetables, and anything I add it to.",12
462,"These are like Doritos, but better!  I would go through a whole bag at once if my husband didn't stop me.  Love the flavor, and no junky ingredients - great with bean dip or guacamole!",16
463,"Having read the other reviews, and having talked to my mother, I feel the need to share my own experience.  I absolutely LOVE this broth.  I find it far, far superior to bouillon cubes in flavor (more on the salt content in a bit).  I rarely eat it on its own however, and I probably wouldn't use it as a base for chicken soup, for which I make homemade broth.  I do enjoy it on its own, but the salt content is high.<br /><br />What this product is ideal for is when you have a recipe that calls for a few cups of broth - risotto, saute, couscous, etc, etc, etc.  When I use it I usually omit any other salt my recipe calls for, and the saltiness of the final dish comes out perfectly.<br /><br />I noticed some of the less than positive reviews don't like the taste of the broth by itself.  I will say, the flavor is very different than many/most store bought stocks and bouillon cubes.  It is very rich and meaty, and tastes like a roasted chicken, WITHOUT vegetables or spices other than salt.  This is just pure chicken flavor, and some may be off put by that -- my mother for instance isn't a big fan - she likes her chicken stock to be very vegetabley.<br /><br />So, if you like a full, meaty chicken (and only chicken) stock, I highly recommend this.  If you want something with more vegetable flavor, look elsewhere.  Personally, I love it.",12
464,"I love peppermint flavored candy, food and beverages--especially during the holidays. These Red Bird ""Peppermint Puffs"" are super light, soft and sugary chunks of melt-in-your-mouth minty goodness. When I worked where I had my own desk, I always kept an old-fashioned apothecary jar of peppermint puffs on my desktop. They disappeared almost as fast as I could fill the jar. Simply terrific!",2
465,I love the unbleached wheat bread flour product blended with another bread flour to make bread in the bread machine for my family. I've been buying consistently for months and have been very happy with it. My bread comes out perfect every time.,13
466,"I have tasted both Green and Oolong Prince of Peace teas.Both are clean,non-dusty , teas that our Asian restaurants in the Montgomery area favor.The oolong is a very light Black tea. I often blend it with another Black tea to give it more of a traditional souther tea flavor because I drink it cold . Oolong is supposed to have more anti-oxidants, however I prefer the stronger flavor of Black teas like Ahmad Engligh #1, Tazo Awake, and Twinnings Breakfast teas. These all blend nicely with the Oolong , and I get the best of each ...ch",16
467,"I have been using K-Cups for about 2 years now.  During that time I have tried several dozen different brands / flavors.  This is by far my favorite, and if you like bold coffee you will probably agree.  I now just stick to this coffee when reordering and also enjoy the decaf version when I feel like a cup in the evening.",16
468,I already reviewed this product but I will let you know again that it is a wonderful tea and would purchase it again in the future and the store was prompt in delivery and contact.,5
469,"Great product. Does not completely get rid of hot flashes and night sweats, but seriously reduces their number and intensity. I tried everything else and this is the only thing that made any difference. I now get reasonable sleep at night.",15
470,"I was worried my dog would turn his nose up at the ""lite"" greenies but he loves them just as much as the regular ones and they make for a great special treat!",11
471,"It's best to buy flaxseeds as opposed to flaxseed oil or meal because you get more omega3. Since you are grinding the seeds yourself, the released omega 3 oils are at their freshest.<br /><br />I recommend storing these flaxseeds in the freezer. You can keep them there after you open them as well. I grind 2 tablespoons in a coffee grinder and then add it to yogurt or a protein shake. Good stuff!",14
472,"I love this tea and can drink it just on its own, but I sometimes add agave,or honey and a little cinnamon......stir, stir, stir it when U add the cinnamon. It really does not get bitter no matter how long you leave the tea bag in.  It's good hot or cold.",4
473,"If there good enough for the King of Sweden (as the box indicates)they are good enough for me. They also have other flavors, all good and the price is right.",8
474,"Love these.  Very tasty, I(or 28month old daughter) can't tell the difference from non-organic ones.",6
475,"This is the real deal right here, folks! Do try this if you like jerk seasoning!",8
476,"I have to drink decaf coffee for health reasons; and, frankly, a lot of them leave a kind of after taste.  Tully's was really AWESOME!!!  If you haven't tried this coffee yet, give it a shot.  It's REALLY good!!!!  The French Roast Decaf has a smooth flavor, and this coffee is one I will DEFINITELY buy again!!!",16
477,"That's some excellent peanut butter. Smooth and creamy texture, spreads easily, good roasted peanut flavor. Not too sweet or too dry. Just right!",12
478,the popcorn was just as expected and love that we can have it automatically ship every 3 months.  No worries about running out,1
479,"Gots to say...I has had jugs of this stuff and its GOOOOD Darn See-rup. Ma DADDY ""MoonShine BILLIE"" Ga bless hims sole...jus loved his flap jacks and see-rup. Wish he'd be here to taste this aw-some Butternut Mountain Farm Maple stuff. Ooh good...and Iz gwana keep on gettin this here stuff till I drop from a sugar over-doze. Ya hoo darn et.",12
480,The coffee is excellent and the service was too!  So was the price with the cost of Keurig K-Cups rising weekly.,0
481,"The cup and the Bombilla showed up within a few days, I cured it over night bam! good to go.<br />My Yerba Mate Store sent a hand written thank you along with a lot of free samples.<br />I would definitely recommend the store and the product.",5
482,The assortment was great. I received 5 to 6 of each flavor. I was a little leary of the blueberry but it is delicious. I will definatly order again!,7
483,"I feed both my kids Earth's Best brand baby/toddler food when I am unable to prepare food myself.  All flavors have a short list of ingredients, good flavor and a nice nutrition profile.<br /><br />I usually wrap these jars in a ziplock bag with a baby spoon and stash in the diaper bag for wholesome food on the go.  I like to feed my toddler what my husband or I eat, but it is great having a back-up if she is really not hip to the entree.<br /><br />Earths Best is the next best thing to mom's cooking ;)<br /><br />Off label use:<br />If you are out of oil when making baked goods, like pumpkin muffins, you can add a jar of complimentary flavored baby food in a pinch and they will still come out moist! Happy accidents are worth sharing!",9
484,"We had a chocolate tasting party with 10 different chocolate bars.  This was the unanimous favorite, even among self proclaimed milk chocolate people.",2
485,"I had never tried Davidson's tea before when I ordered the Herbal Chamomile and Fruit, 16 ounce bag.  It is wonderful.  I love Chamomile tea and the added fruit flavor is great.",4
486,"This is a very small ingredient in Arroz Con Pollo, which is a Cuban dish, but it is necessary to make the flavor complete.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O8KKB2"">Bijol Coloring and Seasoning Condiment 2 oz</a>  Having no Cuban markets near us, I would have to arrange to have a friend ship it to me.  I was very happy to find it online and be able to purchase for myself. Very fast shipping and the product arrived in great shape.",5
487,"As a child, we always had halva onhand. Forty years later the brand I was familiar with was not to be found, so I decided to try this manufacture. The first order was for 3. While the taste is not exactly like the old brand, it comes close enough and I ordered 6 more! The chocolate swirl and all the other fancied up halvas never appealed to me. This Koska Plain Halva hits the spot! I love it. The containers are better than the  old round tins, easy to open, and reusable to store small items in my workshop.<br /><br />I heartily recommend Koska Plain Tahini Halva. Halva has a taste all it's own.",8
488,If you love Kalamata olives... you'll love this oil. It makes a great salad dressing... drizzle it on tomatoes and fresh mozzarella or grilled eggplant. It has become a staple in my home.,9
489,We have been using this for almost a year now and having a subscription order really makes the coffee a good buy besides having such a great expresso taste.,16
490,"This is an awesome snack.  I haven't had regular pretezels in 4 years so I'm going by an old memory, but these taste similar to what I remember pretezels were like.  The shape is an ""0"" instead of a traditional pretzel shape.  I like that the serving size is 40 of them; I can eat a lot of them without feeling guilty about it.",8
491,The price for the quantity was the best I could find online.  My wife really enjoys the product so we'll use this supplier again.,0
492,"wow these treats are the best my 2 Labradors love them!! i purchased these for the 3rd time now and i must say they come exactly like the first time. they are perfect for dogs that love biting crunchy foods and its made in the usa so i know im giving my dogs real pork not an imitation from china my dogs love em and if they could speak they would say ""keep 'em coming""! i recommend this product to any dog owners out there looking for treats to give their companions",11
493,"Love this tea. Great mild flavor with no weird additions and no bitter aftertaste. Perfect for breakfast. Wish I didn't like it so much, honestly, because it's not cheap. Lovely presentation with the silky sachets and cute tin; would make a nice gift.",9
494,"I am so glad that Amazon carries DELALLO decaffeniated coffee, because our local grocery store quit caring the decaf one, only the regular.  With everyone being so conscious about health and him being a heart patient, he needs the decaffeinated one.  He loves it.  THANK YOU!!!",0
495,"Earth's Best makes fantastic natural, organic, glass-jarred baby foods.  I don't know if exposing my baby to plasticizers and pesticides would have any harmful long-term effects but I'd rather not take the chance.<br /><br />Others have complained about the price. . . I don't see this as a reason to give a 1-star review.  At the moment, Amazon charges about a dollar per jar, which seems pretty reasonable to deliver something fragile and heavy to my door.",9
496,"the PB2 with coco added is fabulous for eating or cooking.  This one I can mix and eat with a spoon or a pretzel or what have you and be really satisfied.  The PB2 without coco is great for cooking with, but is really dissappointing straight.",8
497,"I love these cherries.  I heard dried cherries were supposed to be good for arthritis.  When I saw these on the Amazon site, I decided to try them.  I had been buying dried cherries in the grocery store and paying lots for them.  Since having these cherries available for a very good price, I eat a handful of them every day, and my arthritis is at the least, bearable.  I really believe they help.  One thing for sure,  they don't hurt anything.",0
498,"This stuff is truly amazing. Previously I had chemotherapy and the drugs took just about all the hormones away, hence giving me hot flashes. Calm helped to restore the balance and get me back on track, since I was kind of young for menopause. It has also taken my monthly cycle from 30-45 days right down to 28 days. It really is a great product. Magnesium is also wonderful for helping the body absorb calcium. I have been taking it for almost 8 months and I wouldn't think of stopping.",15
499,"I hesitated to try this as, frankly, powdered peanut butter sounded repulsive.  However, since I was getting free shipping, I gave it a try.  At first taste, I thought it maybe needed a little more salt, but by my second taste, I was hooked on it, just as it is.  I like that I can add a tiny bit more water than it calls for and make it a little creamier, easier to spread.  I LOVE peanut butter, but almost always avoid it because of the fat and calories (even though I know ""it's a good fat"").  When you're counting calories, you just can't have 200 calories for 2T of peanut butter very often.  45 calories?  Done!  I love this stuff and don't think I will ever be without it in my pantry again.",12
